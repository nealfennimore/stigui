The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Many NACs include the ability to create network access control policies that include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. 

It is recommended that Forescout have the capability to expose collected data on the assessed endpoints through an API that can be accessed externally, or the NAC solution must supply an SDK to allow customers to export data. 

Admissions assessment filters should include, at a minimum, device attributes such as type, IP address, resource group, and/or mission conditions as defined in the Forescout SSP. Forescout should also track the following to facilitate security investigations: when each device was last admitted/readmitted to the network; owning organization; owning organization&#x27;s organizational unit; geographic location or the nearest network switch; motherboard serial number and BIOS; globally unique ID; and which unique network access compliance policies each device passed or failed during the latest network admission/readmission.

The client may be denied admission based on a returned posture token. In most Forescout implementations, additional network access authorization policies can also be tied to the user&#x27;s identity, but these features are out of scope for this STIG.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/FS_NAC_STIG/groups/V-233310">V-233310</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4 text-center"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300">high</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">Endpoint policy assessment must proceed after the endpoint attempting access has been identified using an approved identification method such as IP address.

Organizational policy must be established for what Forescout will check on the host for the agent and agentless. The Forescout system security plan (SSP) will be used to assess compliance with the requirement since each SSP item must be configured.

Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Verification that anti-virus software is authorized, running, and virus signatures are up to date.
- Host-based firewall installed and configured according to the organization&#x27;s security policy.
- Host IDS/IPS is installed, operational, and up to date.

This requirement does not mandate a remediation network be used, but rather requires that it be secured where used. For example, unauthenticated devices must not be allowed to connect to remediation networks. 

Many sites block unauthorized traffic directly using the Forescout. Forescout accepts only endpoints with IP addresses that are in range. Configure Forescout to identify the endpoint. By default, the IP address is used as the endpoint identifier. The system can be configured to capture the following other endpoint unique identifiers if approved for use by the SSP as the identification method: BIOS Serial number and other hardcoded attributes, OS host name, etc.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/FS_NAC_STIG/groups/V-233312">V-233312</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4 text-center"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300">high</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">If a device requesting access fails Forescout policy assessment, Forescout must communicate with other components and the switch to either terminate the session or isolate the device from the trusted network for remediation.

This is especially important prior to posture assessment to ensure authorized devices are online and have the proper posture prior to accessing the production network.

Device authentication is a solution enabling an organization to manage devices. It is an additional layer of authentication ensuring that only specific preauthorized devices can access the system. Authentication methods for NAC include, but are not limited to, Kerberos, MAC, or other protocols.

The IP Assignment Forescout configuration ensures any IP addresses that should be managed by the configured network will go through the policies within Forescout. Forescout policy structure is applied in a &quot;waterfall&quot; like way that assures all IP addresses start with the top most policy and flow down the policy tree. This policy flow ensures that all endpoints are properly identified, classified, and authenticated prior to the posture assessment.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/FS_NAC_STIG/groups/V-233327">V-233327</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4 text-center"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300">medium</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">Forescout must be configured to apply dynamic ACLs that restrict the use of ports when non-entity endpoints are connected using MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB).

This is required for compliance with C2C Step 4.</td><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">Limiting the number of registered MAC addresses on a switch access port can help prevent a CAM table overflow attack. This type of attack lets an attacker exploit the hardware and memory limitations of a switch. If there are enough entries stored in a CAM table before the expiration of other entries, no new entries can be accepted into the CAM table. An attacker will be able to flood the switch with mostly invalid MAC addresses until the CAM table&#x27;s resources have been depleted. When there are no more resources, the switch has no choice but to flood all ports within the VLAN with all incoming traffic. This happens because the switch cannot find the switch port number for a corresponding MAC address within the CAM table, allowing the switch to become a hub and traffic to be monitored.

Some technologies are exempt from requiring a single MAC address per access port; however, restrictions still apply. VoIP or VTC endpoints may provide a PC port so a PC can be connected. Each of the devices will need to be statically assigned to each access port.

Hot-desking is where several people are assigned to work at the same desk at different times, each user with their own PC. In this case, a different MAC address needs to be permitted for each PC that is connecting to the LAN drop in the workspace. Additionally, this workspace could contain a single phone (and possibly desktop VTC endpoint) used by all assignees, and the PC port on it might be the connection for their laptop. In this case, it is best not to use sticky port security but to use a static mapping of authorized devices.

If this is not a teleworking remote location, this exemption does not apply.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/FS_NAC_STIG/groups/V-233331">V-233331</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4 text-center"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300">medium</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">For TLS connections, Forescout must automatically terminate the session when a client certificate is requested and the client does not have a suitable certificate.

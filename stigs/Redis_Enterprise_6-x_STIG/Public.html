databases challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. 

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to act on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

The DBMS must be configured to automatically use organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization&#x27;s current account policy. 

Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization&#x27;s automated account management requirements.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG/groups/V-251185">V-251185</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Redis Enterprise DBMS must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the DBMS. To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. 

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. 

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. 

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG/groups/V-251226">V-251226</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Redis Enterprise DBMS must enforce authorized access to all PKI private keys stored/used by Redis Enterprise DBMS.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates. PKI certificate-based authentication is performed by requiring the certificate holder to cryptographically prove possession of the corresponding private key.

If the private key is stolen, an attacker can use the private key(s) to impersonate the certificate holder. In cases where the DBMS-stored private keys are used to authenticate the DBMS to the system&#x27;s clients, loss of the corresponding private keys would allow an attacker to successfully perform undetected man-in-the-middle attacks against the DBMS system and its clients.

Both the holder of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must take careful measures to protect the corresponding private key. Private keys should always be generated and protected in FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules.

All access to the private key(s) of the DBMS must be restricted to authorized and authenticated users. If unauthorized users have access to one or more of the DBMS&#x27;s private keys, an attacker could gain access to the key(s) and use them to impersonate the database on the network or otherwise perform unauthorized actions.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG/groups/V-251228">V-251228</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Redis Enterprise DBMS must obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates.

Normally, with PKI authentication, the interaction with the user for authentication will be handled by a software component separate from the DBMS, such as ActivID ActivClient. However, in cases where the DBMS controls the interaction, this requirement applies.

To prevent the compromise of authentication information such as passwords and PINs during the authentication process, the feedback from the system must not provide any information that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism. 

Obfuscation of user-provided authentication secrets when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk. 

Displaying asterisks when a user types in a password or a smart card PIN is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication secrets.

This calls for review of applications, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG/groups/V-251229">V-251229</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Redis Enterprise DBMS must use NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules for cryptographic operations.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Use of weak or not validated cryptographic algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption and digital signatures to protect data. Weak algorithms can be easily broken and not validated cryptographic modules may not implement algorithms correctly. Unapproved cryptographic modules or algorithms should not be relied on for authentication, confidentiality, or integrity. Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of the DBMS.

Applications, including DBMSs, utilizing cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.  

NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based encryption modules.

The standard for validating cryptographic modules will transition to the NIST FIPS 140-3 publication.

FIPS 140-2 modules can remain active for up to five years after validation or until September 21, 2026, when the FIPS 140-2 validations will be moved to the historical list. Even on the historical list, CMVP supports the purchase and use of these modules for existing systems. While Federal Agencies decide when they move to FIPS 140-3 only modules, purchasers are reminded that for several years there may be a limited selection of FIPS 140-3 modules from which to choose. CMVP recommends purchasers consider all modules that appear on the Validated Modules Search Page:
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: 
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
GRANT
REVOKE
DENY

There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include:
TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

Depending on the capabilities of the DBMS and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.

The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the DBMS and is closely associated with the DBA and system administrator roles. The DBA or system administrator will usually coordinate the allocation of physical drive space with the application owner/installer and the application will prompt the installer to provide the capacity information, the physical location of the disk, or both.

In determining the capacity requirements, consider such factors as: total number of users; expected number of concurrent users during busy periods; number and type of events being monitored; types and amounts of data being captured; the frequency/speed with which audit records are offloaded to the central log management system; and any limitations that exist on the DBMS&#x27;s ability to reuse the space formerly occupied by offloaded records.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG/groups/V-251196">V-251196</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Redis Enterprise DBMS must offload audit data to a separate log management facility; this must be continuous and in near real time for systems with a network connection to the storage facility, and weekly or more often for stand-alone systems.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.

Offloading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity. 

The DBMS may write audit records to database tables, to files in the file system, to other kinds of local repository, or directly to a centralized log management system. Whatever the method used, it must be compatible with offloading the records to the centralized system.

When availability is an overriding concern, approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: 

(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the DBMS must continue generating audit records, if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the DBMS must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

Multiple applications can provide a cumulative negative effect.

For example, an exploit to a web server process that leads to unauthorized administrative access to host system directories can most likely lead to a compromise of all applications hosted by the same system.

A certificate&#x27;s certification path is the path from the end entity certificate to a trusted root certification authority (CA). Certification path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed decision regarding acceptance of an end entity certificate. Certification path validation includes checks such as certificate issuer trust, time validity, and revocation status for each certificate in the certification path. Revocation status information for CA and subject certificates in a certification path is commonly provided via certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or online certificate status protocol (OCSP) responses.

Database Management Systems that do not validate certificates by performing RFC 5280-compliant certification path validation are in danger of accepting certificates that are invalid and/or counterfeit. This could allow unauthorized access to the database.

Databases must fail to a known consistent state. Transactions must be successfully completed or rolled back.

All data is stored and managed exclusively in either RAM or RAM + Flash Memory (Redis on Flash) and therefore, is at risk of being lost upon a process or server failure. As Redis Enterprise Software is not just a caching solution, but also a full-fledged database, persistence to disk is critical. Therefore, Redis Enterprise Software supports persisting data to disk on a per-database basis.

Append Only File (AOF) is a continuous writing of data to disk Snapshot. It is not a replacement for backups but should be done in addition to backups. 

AOF writes the latest &quot;write&quot; commands into a file either every second or during every write. It resembles a traditional RDBMS&#x27;s redo log. This file can later be replayed to recover from a crash.

To ensure data availability, Redis Enterprise Software must be implemented in, at a minimum, a three-node cluster. A three-node cluster can withstand one node failure without data loss. If more than one node is lost in a three-node cluster and persistence is not enabled, then data loss is to be expected.

The Append Only File is a persistence mode that provides much better durability. For instance, using the default data fsync policy, Redis can lose just one second of writes in a dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something goes wrong with the Redis process itself, but the operating system is still running correctly. AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems. If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file with the better durability guarantees. Check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

Redis Labs additionally recommends using the wait command. Review the wait command at: https://redis.io/commands/wait and determine if this meets organizational needs.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG/groups/V-251241">V-251241</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">In the event of a system failure, Redis Enterprise DBMS must preserve any information necessary to determine cause of failure and any information necessary to return to operations with least disruption to mission processes.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Failure to a known state can address safety or security in accordance with the mission/business needs of the organization.

Failure to a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system.

Preserving information system state information helps to facilitate system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption of mission/business processes.

Since it is usually not possible to test this capability in a production environment, systems should either be validated in a testing environment or prior to installation. This requirement is usually a function of the design of the IDPS component. Compliance can be verified by acceptance/validation processes or vendor attestation.

It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of LUA and SQL. In such cases, the attacker deduces the manner in which code is processed, either from inside knowledge or by observing system behavior in response to invalid inputs. When the attacker identifies scenarios where code is executed dynamically, the attacker is then able to craft input strings that subvert it. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.

The principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic execution except where it provides necessary functionality that cannot be used otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).

Because Redis does not rely on a query language, there is no known method of SQL injection that would apply to Redis. Redis is a key value store and relies on commands that do not have a unified query language. Redis does have an embedded LUA interpreter and the user will need to disable these.

When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:
- Allow strings as input only when necessary. 
- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.
- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.
- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.
- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. 
- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.
- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. 
- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.
- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding by a party other than the developer.
- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.
- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.
- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities, but it may also itself be the attacker.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG/groups/V-251251">V-251251</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Redis Enterprise DBMS and associated applications, when making use of dynamic code execution, must scan input data for invalid values that may indicate a code injection attack.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">With respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as code injection.

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. 

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). 

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period used must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

The application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).

Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.

This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.

The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.

The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.

(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Redis_Enterprise_6-x_STIG/groups/V-251252">V-251252</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 dark:bg-yellow-900 dark:text-yellow-300"><span>low</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">When updates are applied to Redis Enterprise DBMS software, any software components that have been replaced or made unnecessary must be removed.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Previous versions of DBMS components that are not removed from the information system after updates have been installed may be exploited by adversaries. 

Some DBMSs&#x27; installation tools may remove older versions of software automatically from the information system. In other cases, manual review and removal will be required.

A transition period may be necessary when both the old and the new software are required.

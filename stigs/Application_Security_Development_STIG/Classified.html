Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to a restricted asset or security boundary.

Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.

Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset.

Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies.

Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography.

These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications (e.g., authentication servers) and other applications that perform information and system access control functions.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222430">V-222430</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application must execute without excessive account permissions.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Applications are often designed to utilize a user account.  The account represents a means to control application permissions and access to OS resources, application resources or both.  

When the application is designed and installed, care must be taken not to assign excessive permissions to the user account that is used by the application.  

An application operating with unnecessary privileges can potentially give an attacker access to the underlying operating system or if the privileges required for application execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking such applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by organizations.

Passwords need to be protected at all times and using a strong one-way hashing encryption algorithm with a salt is the standard method for providing a means to validate a user&#x27;s password without having to store the actual password. 

Performance and time required to access are factors that must be considered and the one way hash is the most feasible means of securing the password and providing an acceptable measure of password security. If passwords are stored in clear text, they can be plainly read and easily compromised.

In many instances, verifying the user knows a password is performed using a password verifier. In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the hash. 

A more secure version of verifying a user knowing a password is to store the result of an iterating hash function and a large random SALT value as follows:

H0 = H(pwd, H(salt))
Hn = H(Hn-1,H(salt))

Where n is a cryptographically-strong random [*3] number. Hn is stored, along with the salt. When the application wishes to verify that the user knows a password, it simply repeats the process and compares Hn with the stored Hn.

A SALT is essentially a fixed-length cryptographically-strong random value. 

Another method used is utilizing a keyed hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC calculates a message authentication code via a cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with an encryption key. The key must be protected as with any private key.
 
Applications must only store passwords that have been cryptographically protected.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222543">V-222543</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application must transmit only cryptographically-protected passwords.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Use of passwords for application authentication is intended only for limited situations and should not be used as a replacement for two-factor CAC-enabled authentication.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

Obfuscation of user-provided information when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk.

For example, displaying asterisks when a user types in a password is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication information.

Another method is to display authentication feedback for a very limited time, usually in fractions of a second. This occurs during password character entry where the password characters are displayed for a very small window of time and then automatically obfuscated. This allows users with just enough time to confirm their password as they type it while limiting the ability of &quot;shoulder surfers&quot; to covertly witness the values.

A common tactic employed to circumvent password obfuscation is to copy the obfuscated password and paste it to a text file.

Examples include applications that handle extremely sensitive data or those used in life and death situations, e.g., weapons systems. 

General purpose applications such as a web site will often opt to leverage an underlying software based encryption capability that is offered by the OS, database or application development framework.

This requirement applies to applications that utilize communications sessions. This includes, but is not limited to, web-based applications and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA).

This requirement addresses communications protection at the application session, versus the network packet, and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of information transmitted.

This requirement applies  to those applications that transmit data, or allow access to data non-locally. Application and data owners have a responsibility for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. 

Application and data owners need to identify the data that requires cryptographic protection. If no data protection requirements are defined as to what specific data must be encrypted and what data is non-sensitive and doesn&#x27;t require encryption, all data must be encrypted.
 
When transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, SSL VPNs, or IPSEC.

Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222601">V-222601</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application must not store sensitive information in hidden fields.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Hidden fields allow developers to process application data without having to display it on the screen.

XSS can be executed via HTML, JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX; essentially any scripting language a browser is capable of processing.

XSS vulnerabilities are created when a website does not properly sanitize, escape, or encode user input. For example, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; is the HTML encoding for the &quot;&lt;&quot; character. If the encoding is performed, the script code will not execute.

There are 3 parties involved in an XSS attack, the attacker, the trusted and vulnerable website, and the victim. An attacker will take advantage of a vulnerable website that does not properly validate user input by inserting malicious code into any data entry field.

When the victim visits the trusted website and clicks on the malicious link left by the attacker, the attacker’s script is executed in the victims browser with the trust permissions assigned to the site.

There are several different types of XSS attack and the complete details regarding XSS cannot be described completely here.

To address the issue of XSS, web application developers must escape, encode or otherwise validate all user input that is processed and output by the web server. They should also use web templates or a web development framework that provides the capability to encode or otherwise validate user input.

Examples of XSS vulnerabilities can be obtained from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) website.

The following is an example of a URL based command injection attack.

Before alteration:
http://sitename/cgi-bin/userData.pl?doc=user1.txt

Example URL modified:

Successful attacks can read data, write data, execute administrative functions within the database, shutdown the DBMS, and in some cases execute OS commands.

Best practices to reduce the potential for SQL Injection vulnerabilities include:

Not using concatenation or replacement to build SQL queries.

Using prepared statements with parameterized queries that have been tested and validated not to be vulnerable to SQL Injection.

Using stored procedures that have been tested and validated not to be vulnerable to SQL Injection.

Escaping all user supplied input.

- Client data entry fields

Items to validate:

- Out of range values/Boundary 
- Data length 
- Validate types of characters allowed
- Whitelist validation for known good data input while denying all other input.

Other recommendations include: 

- Using drop down menus for lists
- Validating input on the server, not on the client.

If validating on the client, also validate on the server:

- Using regular expressions to validate input
- Using HTML filter libraries that implement input validation tasks.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222612">V-222612</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application must not be vulnerable to overflow attacks.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">A buffer overflow occurs when a program exceeds the amount of data allocated to a buffer. The buffer is a sequential section of memory and when the data is written outside the memory bounds, the program can crash or malicious code can be executed.

Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.

Buffer overflows can manifest as stack overflows, heap overflows integer overflows and format string overflows. Each type of overflow is dependent upon the underlying application language and the context in which the overflow is executed.

Integer overflows can lead to infinite looping when loop index variables are compromised and cause a denial of service.  If the integer is used in data references, the data can become corrupt. Also, using the integer in memory allocation can cause buffer overflows, and a denial of service.  Integers used in access control mechanisms can potentially trigger buffer overflows, which can be used to execute arbitrary code. 

Almost all known web servers, application servers, and web application environments are susceptible to buffer overflows. Proper validation of user input is required to mitigate the risk. Notably, limiting the size of the strings a user is allowed to input to a program to a predetermined, acceptable length.

Security controls must be in place in order to provide different levels and types of defenses for each type of server based upon data protection requirements identified by policy or data owner.

DoD DMZ policy specifies that logical separation is allowed but when hosting different data types on the same server, physical separation is required.

1) Unrestricted web servers and Restricted web servers must be on separate virtual or physical servers from Private web servers, application servers, or database servers.
2) Unrestricted web servers and Restricted web servers can either be on separate physical servers from each other, or they can be on separate virtual servers.
3) If application and database servers have been separated by service type into Unrestricted, Restricted, and Private servers (permitted but not required in Increment 1 Phase 1), they must be on separate virtual or physical servers from each other by server type (Application or Database) and by service type (Unrestricted, Restricted, or Private).

Reference the DoD DMZ STIG for details on data types and separation requirements.

Security controls include firewalls or other forms of access controls that restrict the ability to traverse the network from one system to the other.

Separation can be performed either physically or logically based upon data protection and application protection design requirements.

Physically separate networks require distinct physical network devices for connections (e.g., two separate switches or two separate routers).

Physically separate machines utilize a non-virtual OS.

Logically separate networks are usually implemented via a VLAN.

Logically separate systems are implemented with virtual machines or other system emulation.

Security controls are firewall rules or ACLs that provide access restrictions on network traffic and limit communications between systems to only application and application/system support traffic.

The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based upon mission needs and the operational environment for each system.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222388">V-222388</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application must clear temporary storage and cookies when the session is terminated.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Persistent cookies are a primary means by which a web application will store application state and user information.  Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, this persistence allows the web application developer to provide a robust and customizable user experience.

However, if a web application stores user authentication information within a persistent cookie or other temporary storage mechanism, this information can be stolen and used to compromise the users account.

Likewise, HTML 5 provides the developer with a client storage capability where application data larger than the 4K cookie size limit can be stored on the local client.  While this can be beneficial to the developer, this is considered insecure storage and should not be used for storing sensitive session or security tokens.  A cross site scripting attack can put this data at risk.

Web applications must clear sensitive data from files and storage areas on the client when the session is terminated.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222389">V-222389</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application must automatically terminate the non-privileged user session and log off non-privileged users after a 15 minute idle time period has elapsed.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Leaving a user’s application session established for an indefinite period of time increases the risk of session hijacking.

Manual examples include but are not limited to admin staff logging into the system or systems and manually performing step by step actions affecting user accounts that could otherwise be automated.  This does not include any manual steps taken to initiate automated processes or the use of automated systems.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.

The application must be configured to automatically provide account management functions and these functions must immediately enforce the organization&#x27;s current account policy. The automated mechanisms may reside within the application itself or may be offered by the operating system or other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization&#x27;s automated account management requirements.

Account management functions include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222408">V-222408</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Shared/group account credentials must be terminated when members leave the group.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">If shared/group account credentials are not terminated when individuals leave the group, the user that left the group can still gain access even though they are no longer authorized.

Data mining occurs when the application is programmatically probed and data is automatically extracted. While there are valid uses for data mining within data sets, the organization should be mindful that adversaries may attempt to use data mining capabilities built into the application in order to completely extract application data so it can be evaluated using methods that are not natively offered by the application. This can provide the adversary with an opportunity to utilize inference attacks or obtain additional insights that might not have been intended when the application was designed.

Methods of extraction include database queries or screen scrapes using the application itself. The entity performing the data mining must have access to the application in order to extract the data.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

An ISSM and ISSO approved process must be created and followed to ensure the user requesting access is properly authenticated prior to access being re-established.

The process must include having the user provide information only the user would know and having the administrator verify the accuracy of the information prior to unlocking the account. This means having the user provide this information when their account is created so the information can be referenced when they are locked out.    

The process utilized may be manual in nature, however it is recognized that password resets are a time consuming task. To minimize helpdesk resource constraints related to user lockout requests, procedures may be automated by administrators in order to unlock the account or reset the password.  

Authentication process examples include having the user provide personal information known only by the user and provided when the account was created and/or using Out-of-Band or side channel communication methods such as text messages to the users established cell phone number in order to provide a temporary password or token that can be used to logon once and reset the password.

Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include, for example, Security Information Management products.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222488">V-222488</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application must provide the capability to filter audit records for events of interest based upon organization-defined criteria.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">The ability to specify the event criteria that are of interest provides the persons reviewing the logs with the ability to quickly isolate and identify these events without having to review entries that are of little or no consequence to the investigation.

The testing must cover all aspects and components of the application architecture.  If an application consists of a web server and a database, then both components must be tested for vulnerabilities to the fullest extent possible.

Vulnerability assessment tests normally utilize a combination of specialized software called application vulnerability scanners as well as custom scripts and manual tests.  In some instances, multiple tools are required in order to test all aspects of application features, functions and architecture.  The vulnerability scanner is typically configured to communicate with the application through the user interface or via an applications communication port.  In addition to using automated tools, manual tests conducted from the OS console such as executing custom scripts or reviewing configuration settings for known vulnerabilities may also be included as part of the test.

Testers will typically utilize application user test accounts in order to test application features and functionality such as adding content, executing queries and completing transactions. The vulnerability testing software utilizes user actions and access as well as a list of known security vulnerabilities in order to detect and identify weak security controls or misconfigurations that could potentially be manipulated by the user or create a security vulnerability.

A3 XSS
A4 Insecure Direct Object References
A5 Security Misconfiguration

Examples of hardware devices include but are not limited to mobile phones, application gateways, or other types of smart hardware.

This requirement does not apply to individual application user accounts.

This requirement is not applicable to shared information system accounts, application groups, or roles (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts) that are used by the application itself in order to function. Care must be taken to not disable identifiers that are used by the application in order to function.

Inactive device identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications. Attackers that are able to exploit an inactive identifier can potentially obtain and maintain undetected access to the application.

Applications need to track periods of device inactivity and disable the device identifier after 35 days of inactivity. This is usually accomplished by disabling the account used by the device to access the application.

Applications that use cryptographic certificates for device authentication may use the expiration date assigned to the certificate to meet this requirement with the understanding that the certificate is created and managed in accordance with DOD PKI policy and can be revoked by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

To avoid having to build complex device management capabilities directly into their application, developers should leverage the underlying OS or other account management infrastructure (AD, LDAP) that is already in place within the organization and meets organizational user account management requirements.

Applications are encouraged to utilize a centralized data store such as Active Directory or LDAP to offload device management requirements and ensure compliance with policy requirements.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222537">V-222537</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one uppercase character be used.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Use of passwords for application authentication is intended only for limited situations and should not be used as a replacement for two-factor CAC-enabled authentication.

Restricting this setting limits the user&#x27;s ability to change their password.

Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords need to be changed at specific intervals.

One method of minimizing this risk is to use complex passwords and periodically change them. If the application does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the system and/or application passwords could be compromised.

Protections must be utilized when establishing a password change or reset capability to prevent user A from changing user B&#x27;s password.

Protection is usually accomplished by having each user provide an out of bounds (OOB) communication address such as a separate email address or SMS/text address (mobile phone) that can be used to transmit password reset/change information.

This  OOB information is usually provided by the user when the user account is created.   The OOB information is validated as part of the user account creation process by sending an account validation request to the OOB address and having the user respond to the request.

Simply removing a user from a web application without terminating any existing application user sessions can introduce a scenario where the deleted user still has access to the application even though their account has been deleted from the authentication store. This can be attributed to browser caching and session management on the web server.

To address this, the web application must provide a means for ensuring this type of &quot;zombie&quot; access does not occur.

Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system level network connection. 

This does not mean that the application terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

Many applications rely on the underlying OS to control the network connection aspect of the application which is perfectly acceptable.

Additionally, application specific operational issues may occasionally be encountered which dictate exceptions be granted to this requirement in order to ensure continuity of operations and application availability.

This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes in DoD or other government agencies.

There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files on storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222593">V-222593</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">XML-based applications must mitigate DoS attacks by using XML filters, parser options, or gateways.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users.

XML-based applications are susceptible to DoS attacks due to the nature of XML parsing being processor intensive and complicated.

Best practice for parsing XML to avoid DoS include:

- Using a proven XML parser
- Using an XML gateway that provides DoS protection
- Using parser options that provide limits on recursive payloads, oversized payloads, and entity expansion.

This requirement addresses the configuration of applications to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on application availability. For each application, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or restricting the number of sessions the application opens at one time).

Individuals of concern can include hostile insiders or external adversaries that have access or have successfully breached the information system and are using the system as a platform to launch cyber attacks on the application, the application host or other third-parties.

Application developers and application administrators must take the steps needed to ensure an application cannot be used to launch DoS attacks against the application itself, the application host or other systems and networks. 

Application developers should be cognizant that many attackers using DoS techniques will attempt to identify resource intensive processes and functions within the application.  For web applications, this can be application objects that perform database queries or other resource intensive tasks.  Improper application memory management can also lead to memory leaks which can exhaust system resources forcing a system or application restart.  

Limiting attempts to repeatedly execute application processes by validating the requests also reduces the ability to launch some DoS attacks.

For application administrators, ensuring network access controls are in place to protect the application host.

In the case of application DoS attacks, care must be taken when designing the application to ensure the application makes the best use of system resources. SQL queries have the potential to consume large amounts of CPU cycles if they are not tuned for optimal performance. Web services containing complex calculations requiring large amounts of time to complete can bog down if too many requests for the service are encountered within a short period of time.

The methods employed to meet this requirement will vary depending upon the technology the application utilizes.

A CSRF attack executes a website request on behalf of the user which can lead to a compromise of the user’s data. What is needed to be successful is for the attacker to know the URL, an authenticated application user, and trick the user into clicking the malicious link.

While XSS is not needed for a CSRF attack to work, XSS vulnerabilities can provide the attacker with a vector to obtain information from the user that may be used in mitigating the risk.

Software applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. 

Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. 

Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

Absence of input validation opens an application to improper manipulation of data. The lack of input validation can lead immediate access of application, denial of service, and corruption of data.

Invalid input includes presence of scripting tags within text fields, query string manipulation, and invalid data types and sizes.

When an application validates input, it will only execute provided input after it has evaluated the input, validated the input and determined the data is in an expected format, and content is not extraneous or malformed.

Comprehensive application security testing and code reviews are required to ensure the application is not vulnerable to input validation vulnerabilities.

Application security code reviews should be conducted during the development phase to find and address input validation errors. When code reviews are not possible, fuzz testing can be performed on the application to attempt and identify vulnerable data input fields.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222610">V-222610</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application must generate error messages that provide information necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Only authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of the errors.

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter.

Automated scanning tools expedite and help to standardize security testing, they can incorporate known attack methods and procedures, test for libraries and other software modules known to be vulnerable to attack and utilize a test method known as &quot;fuzz testing&quot;. Fuzz testing is a testing process where the application is provided invalid, unexpected, or random data. Poorly designed and coded applications will become unstable or crash. Properly designed and coded applications will reject improper and unexpected data input from application clients and remain stable.

Many vulnerability scanning tools provide automated fuzz testing capabilities for the testing of web applications. All of these tools help to identify a wide range of application vulnerabilities including, but not limited to; buffer overflows, cross-site scripting flaws, denial of service format bugs and SQL injection, all of which can lead to a successful compromise of the system or result in a denial of service.

Due to changes in the production environment, it is a good practice to schedule periodic active testing of production web applications. Ideally, this will occur prior to deployment and after updates or changes to the application production environment.

It is imperative that automated scanning tools are configured properly to ensure that all of the application components that can be tested are tested. In the case of web applications, some of the application code base may be accessible on the website and could potentially be corrected by a knowledgeable system administrator. Active testing is different from code review testing in that active testing does not require access to the application source code base. A code review requires complete code base access and is normally performed by the development team.

If vulnerability testing is not conducted, there is the distinct potential that security vulnerabilities could be unknowingly introduced into the application environment.

The following website provides an overview of fuzz testing and examples:

There are several different ways that web service deadlock occurs, many times it is due to when a client invokes a synchronous method on a web service, the client will block waiting for the method to complete. If attempts to call the client (invoke a callback) while the client is waiting for the original method to complete, then each party will deadlock waiting for the other.

This is referred to as deadlock. The same situation could occur if a callback handler attempted to call a synchronous method on its caller.

Applications that utilize web services must account for and document how they deal with a deadlock issue. This can be accomplished by documenting data flow and specifically accounting for the risk in the design of the application.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222626">V-222626</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The designer must ensure the application does not store configuration and control files in the same directory as user data.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Application configuration settings and user data are required to be stored in separate locations in order to prevent application users from possibly being able to access application configuration settings or application data files.

To ensure file integrity, application files and/or application packages are cryptographically hashed using a strong hashing algorithm. Comparing hashes after transferring the files makes it possible to detect changes in files that could indicate potential integrity issues with the application.

Currently, SHA256 is the DoD approved standard for cryptographic hash functions. DoD application developers must use SHA256 when creating cryptographic hashes; however, some non-DoD vendors might still use MD5 or SHA1 when generating a checksum hash for their application packages. It is important to use the same algorithms when validating the hash. If a non DoD vendor uses SHA1 when hashing their files, you must use SHA1 to validate the hash. Otherwise, the hashes will not match and a false positive indication of tampering will result.

Prior to release of the application receiving an ATO/IATO for deployment into a DoD operational network, the application must be validated for integrity to ensure no tampering of source code or binaries has occurred. Failure to validate the integrity of application code and/or application binaries prior to deploying an application into a production environment may compromise the operational network.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222646">V-222646</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">At least one tester must be designated to test for security flaws in addition to functional testing.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">If there is no person designated to test for security flaws, vulnerabilities can potentially be missed during testing.

This requirement is meant to apply to developers or organizations that are doing application development work and have the responsibility for maintaining the application source code.

Examples of security flaws include but are not limited to:

- format string exploits
- memory leaks 
- buffer overflows 
- race conditions
- sql injection
- dead/unused/commented code
- input validation exploits

The code review is conducted during the application development phase, this allows discovered security issues to be corrected prior to release.

Code reviews performed after the development phase must eventually go back to development for correction so conducting the code review during development is the logical and preferred action.

Automated code review tools are to be used whenever reviewing application source code. These tools are often incorporated into Integrated Development Environments (IDE) so code reviews can be conducted during all stages of the development life cycle. Periodically reviewing code during the development phase makes transition to a production environment easier as flaws are continually identified and addressed during the development phase rather than en masse at the end of the development effort.

Code review processes and the tools used to conduct the code review analysis will vary depending upon application architecture and the development languages utilized.

In addition to automated testing, manual code reviews may also be used to validate or augment automated code review results. Larger projects will have a large code base and will require the use of automated code review tools in order to achieve complete code review coverage.

A manual code review may consist of a peer review wherein other programmers on the team manually examine source code and automated code review results for known flaws that introduce security bugs into the application.

As with any testing, there is no single best approach and the tests must be tailored to the application architecture. Use of automated tools along with manual review of code and testing results is considered a best practice when conducting code reviews. This method is the most likely way to ensure the maximum number of errors are caught and addressed prior to implementing the application in a production environment.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222650">V-222650</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Flaws found during a code review must be tracked in a defect tracking system.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">This requirement is meant to apply to developers or organizations that are doing application development work.

It is a structured approach that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application. Threat modeling is not an approach to reviewing code, but it does complement the security code review process.

Threat modeling can optimize application security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system.

The lack of threat modeling will potentially leave unidentified threats for attackers to utilize to gain access to the application. To execute a threat model you should do the following:

- Decompose the Application. The first step in the threat modeling process is gaining an understanding of the application and how it interacts with external entities. This includes identifying application components such as web server, application server, database server and languages used by the application. It also includes identifying network connections and the means utilized to access the application.

- Determine and rank threats. Use a threat categorization methodology to understand the different threat categories.
E.g., Auditing, authentication, configuration management and data protection. The goal of the threat categorization is to help identify threats both from the attacker perspective and the defensive perspective.

- Determine countermeasures and mitigation. A lack of protection against a threat might indicate a vulnerability whose risk exposure could be mitigated with the implementation of a countermeasure.

Countermeasures could include using application firewalls, IDS/IPS to block or identify known attacks against the architecture and alarming on audit log events.

Refer to the OWASP website for additional details on application threat modeling.

If a manual code review cannot be performed, static code analysis tools should be employed in conjunction with tests to help force the error conditions by specifying invalid input (such as fuzzed data and malformed filenames) and by using different accounts to run the application. These tests may give indications of vulnerability, but they are not comprehensive.

In order to minimize error handling errors, ensure proper return code and exception handling is implemented throughout the application.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222657">V-222657</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application development team must provide an application incident response plan.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">An application incident response process is managed by the development team and should include a method for individuals to submit potential security vulnerabilities to the development or maintenance team. 

The plan should dictate what is to be done with the reported vulnerabilities. Reported vulnerabilities must be tracked throughout the process to ensure they are triaged, corrected, and tested. The corresponding update is released to the user community and the user community is notified of the availability of the application update.

Without an established application incident management plan and process, discovered issues and vulnerabilities will go unreported.   Vulnerabilities will not be triaged and managed, and there may be delays in corrective actions.

Information on how to submit bug and vulnerability reports must also be included in the application design document or configuration guide.

Code coverage statistics describes the overall functionality provided by the application and how much of the source code has been tested during the release cycle.

To avoid the potential for testing the same pieces of code over and over again, code coverage statistics are used to track which aspects or modules of the application are tested.

Some applications are so large that it is not feasible to test every last bit of the application code on one release cycle. In those instances, it is acceptable to prioritize and identify the modules that are critical to the applications security posture and test those first. Rolling over to test other modules later as resources permit. E.g., testing functionality that performs authentication and authorization before testing printing capabilities.

Application developers should keep statistics that show all of the modules of the application and identify which modules were tested and when. This will help testers to keep track of what has been tested and help to verify all functionality is tested.

The developer makes sure that flaws are documented in a defect tracking system.

If the application is smaller in nature and all aspects of the application can be tested, the code coverage statistics would be 100%.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222653">V-222653</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 dark:bg-yellow-900 dark:text-yellow-300"><span>low</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The application development team must follow a set of coding standards.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Coding standards are guidelines established by the development team or individual developers that recommend programming style, practices and methods.  The coding standards employed will vary based upon the programming language that is being used to develop the application and the development team.

Coding standards often cover the use of white space characters, variable naming conventions, function naming conventions, and comment styles.  Implementing coding standards provides many benefits to the development process.  These benefits include code readability, coding consistency among both individual and teams of developers as well as ease of code integration.  

The following are examples of what will typically be in a coding standards document.  This list is an example of what one can expect to find in typical coding standard documents and is not a comprehensive list:

- Indent style conventions
- Naming conventions
- Line length conventions
- Comment conventions
- Programming best practices
- Programming style conventions

Coding standards allow developers to quickly adapt to code which has been developed by various members of a development team.  Coding standards are useful in the code review process as well as in situations where a team member leaves and duties must then be assigned to another team member.  

Code conforming to a standard format is easier to read, especially if someone other than the original developer is examining the code.  In addition, formatted code can be debugged and corrected faster than unformatted code.

Introducing coding standards can help increase the consistency, reliability, and security of the application by ensuring common programming structures and tasks are handled by similar methods, as well as, reducing the occurrence of common logic errors.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Security_Development_STIG/groups/V-222654">V-222654</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 dark:bg-yellow-900 dark:text-yellow-300"><span>low</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The designer must create and update the Design Document for each release of the application.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">This requirement is meant to apply to developers or organizations that are doing application development work.

This notification should be planned for in the design phase of the application. This notification should be a warning of any potential risks to the application or data.

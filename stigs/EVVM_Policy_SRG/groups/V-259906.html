While this degrades the protections afforded a hardware-based system, the trend is to use more and more PC-based communications applications due to their advanced features, collaborative benefits, and perceived reduced cost. This soft-phone use case results in the elimination of hardware-based telephones on users&#x27; desks in the workplace. This can be seen as, or result in, trading down (from a hardware-based system) with regard to availability, reliability, and quality of service because the data network is generally more susceptible to compromise from many sources inside and outside the local LAN, making the soft-phones more exposed to attack. 

This also means no telephone will be available in the workspace if the PC is not powered on, the application is not loaded, or the PC is not fully functional. While this is undesirable from an IA standpoint, a business case can be developed to support it. 

NOTE: The recommended relationship between PC soft-phone/UC applications and hardware-based endpoints in the normal work area is that the PC application should augment the functionality of, or be a backup to, the hardware-based instrument in the user&#x27;s workspace. The implementation of PC soft-phones or UC applications in the user workspace as their only endpoint has several ramifications that must be considered. These include: 

- The PC becomes a single point of failure for communications services provided to a user in their workspace. A widespread problem, which affects many PCs or the network infrastructure, may disable all communications for many users at one time. Users may not have a means to report the failure without using an alternate communications system. A fast-spreading worm or power outage could create such a situation. While some may argue that &quot;users can call on their cell phones&quot;, service may not be available, or their use may not be permitted in the facility. This translates into the loss of functionality and efficiency, as in lost time, due to the inability to communicate when the PC or soft-phone application is not running or functioning properly.

- The protections afforded hardware-based endpoints by the use of the voice protection zone, such as VoIP VLAN(s) and others, are missing for soft-phones in a widespread use/implementation scenario and, depending on the implementation on the PC, may degrade the protections afforded hardware-based endpoints. Such is the case for all software-based communications endpoints because they are typically implemented on all PCs and therefore will be connected to the data VLANs. Assured service for voice traffic will be degraded from that obtained with hardware-based instruments connected in the voice protection zone. This translates into the following additional IA measures required to protect the VoIP infrastructure (e.g., a firewall between the VoIP and data VLANs):
 
- The hardware-based endpoint is not available for use in parallel with, or in place of, the PC. This can be a problem if the PC is having performance or operational issues, is turned off, or is unavailable. Accessing help desk services requiring logging on to the PC to use the voice services and work on a problem could be a real challenge. Rebooting the PC to clear a problem would disconnect the call to the helpdesk. Accessing voice mail or answering the phone while the PC is booting is made impossible, reducing efficiency, particularly when the user starts their day. If the user has command and control (C2) responsibilities, the IP equivalent of MLPP cannot function properly if an application or PC is unavailable. Precedence calls will not be received by the user but will be transferred to their designated alternate answering point. 

- Emergency communications could be unavailable if the PC is not booted, the communications application is not running, or either is otherwise compromised. Voice communications must be readily available for life safety and medical reasons, as well as other facility security emergencies. A partial mitigation for this in a &quot;soft-phone world&quot; is to place common use hardware telephones within a short distance (e.g., 30 to 50 feet) of every workspace, which is an additional cost. This additional distance, however, could be an issue in a medical emergency where a worker might be alone in their workspace and their PC or voice communications application is not functioning properly. They may not be able to reach the common use instrument depending on the nature of the medical emergency. If the worker was suffering a heart attack or diabetic emergency, they could die. Business cases therefore need to include the cost of insurance and/or lawsuits for this eventuality. 

The previous two items translate into the following the addition of common-use hardware-based instruments placed around the facility (for backup and emergency use) along with the additionally required LAN cabling and access switch ports. While some may believe this is not an IA issue, it is because the discussion is about availability, which is one of the prime tenets of IA. 

Additionally, the VoIP controllers (i.e., the equipment that controls the telephone system) must be able to be accessed by the PC soft-phones while being protected as they would be in a normal VoIP system using hardware-based instruments.

- The hardware-based endpoint is not available for use in parallel with, or in place of, the PC. This can be a problem if the PC is having performance or operational issues, is turned off, or is unavailable. Accessing help desk services requiring logging on to the PC to use the voice services and work on a problem could be a real challenge. Rebooting the PC to clear a problem would disconnect the call to the helpdesk. Accessing voice mail or answering the phone while the PC is booting is made impossible, reducing efficiency, particularly when the user starts their day. If the user has command and control (C2) responsibilities, the IP equivalent of MLPP cannot function properly if an application or PC is unavailable. Precedence calls will not be received by the user but will be transferred to their designated alternate answering point. 

- Emergency communications could be unavailable if the PC is not booted, the communications application is not running, or either is otherwise compromised. Voice communications must be readily available for life safety and medical reasons, as well as other facility security emergencies. A partial mitigation for this in a &quot;soft-phone world&quot; is to place common use hardware telephones within a short distance (e.g., 30 to 50 feet) of every workspace, which is an additional cost. This additional distance, however, could be an issue in a medical emergency where a worker might be alone in their workspace and their PC or voice communications application is not functioning properly. They may not be able to reach the common use instrument depending on the nature of the medical emergency. If the worker was suffering a heart attack or diabetic emergency, they could die. Business cases therefore need to include the cost of insurance and/or lawsuits for this eventuality. 

The previous two items translate into the following the addition of common-use hardware-based instruments placed around the facility (for backup and emergency use) along with the additionally required LAN cabling and access switch ports. While some may believe this is not an IA issue, it is because the discussion is about availability, which is one of the prime tenets of IA. 

Additionally, the VoIP controllers (i.e., the equipment that controls the telephone system) must be able to be accessed by the PC soft-phones while being protected as they would be in a normal VoIP system using hardware-based instruments. 

NOTE: Methods for permitting the necessary PC traffic to, from, and between the voice and data zones while protecting the voice zone will be discussed later in this document.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section class="w-full flex flex-col"><div class="relative overflow-x-auto shadow-md sm:rounded-lg"><table class="w-full text-sm text-left rtl:text-right text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400"><thead class="text-xs text-zinc-700 uppercase bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-400"><tr><th scope="col" class="px-6 py-3">ℹ️ Check</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="even:bg-white even:dark:bg-zinc-900 odd:bg-zinc-50 odd:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200 text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line"><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">Part 1:
Determine if PC soft-phones and/or UC applications are implemented as the primary telephone endpoint in users&#x27; workspaces. If so, inspect users&#x27; work areas to determine if hardware-based telephone instruments are installed within a short distance (e.g., 30 to 50 feet) of every workspace to be used for backup and emergency communications. Cellphones, PDA/PEDs, or other wireless devices are not considered reliable enough to meet this requirement due to lack of reliable signal available everywhere and their inability to be used in certain DOD environments. 

If these conditions are not met, this is a finding. 

NOTE: This requirement is satisfied by the implementation of hard-wired hardware-based telephone instruments using any telephony technology. That is, traditional analog or digital instruments may be used, or VoIP-based instruments may be used. Such instruments may be part of the local site&#x27;s PBX or VoIP system or may be served from the Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or Competitive LEC (CLEC). Power is another concern when implementing backup/continuity of operations (COOP) or emergency telephones. Such phones should be remotely powered from a source that can provide backup power. Additionally, the dialing capabilities of backup/COOP or emergency telephones may be limited to internal and/or emergency calls. This means that minimally, emergency service numbers must be reachable from these phones.

Select a random sample if not all of the implemented hard-phones and test them to ensure they are functional.

Such is the case for all software-based communications endpoints because they are typically implemented on all PCs and therefore will be connected to the data VLANs.

This can be a problem if the PC is having performance or operational issues, is turned off, or is unavailable. Accessing help desk services requiring logging on to the PC to use the voice services and work on a problem could be a real challenge. Rebooting the PC to clear a problem would disconnect the call to the helpdesk.

This soft-phone use case results in the elimination of hardware-based telephones on users' desks in the workplace. This can be seen as, or result in, trading down (from a hardware-based system) with regard to availability, reliability, and quality of service because the data network is generally more susceptible to compromise from many sources inside and outside the local LAN, making the soft-phones more exposed to attack. \n\nThis also means no telephone will be available in the workspace if the PC is not powered on, the application is not loaded, or the PC is not fully functional. While this is undesirable from an IA standpoint, a business case can be developed to support it. \n\nNOTE: The recommended relationship between PC soft-phone/UC applications and hardware-based endpoints in the normal work area is that the PC application should augment the functionality of, or be a backup to, the hardware-based instrument in the user's workspace. The implementation of PC soft-phones or UC applications in the user workspace as their only endpoint has several ramifications that must be considered. These include: \n\n- The PC becomes a single point of failure for communications services provided to a user in their workspace. A widespread problem, which affects many PCs or the network infrastructure, may disable all communications for many users at one time.

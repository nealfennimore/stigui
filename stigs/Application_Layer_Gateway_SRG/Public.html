entity access to an asset or security boundary. The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.

Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. ALGs must use these policies and mechanisms to control access on behalf of the application for which it is acting as intermediary.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Layer_Gateway_SRG/groups/V-204910">V-204910</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The ALG must enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the network based on attribute- and content-based inspection of the source, destination, headers, and/or content of the communications traffic.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network.

Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems. Examples of information flow control restrictions include keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet or blocking information marked as classified but is being transported to an unapproved destination.

ALGs enforce approved authorizations by employing security policy and/or rules that restrict information system services, provide packet filtering capability based on header or protocol information and/or message filtering capability based on data content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Layer_Gateway_SRG/groups/V-204911">V-204911</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The ALG must restrict or block harmful or suspicious communications traffic by controlling the flow of information between interconnected networks based on attribute- and content-based inspection of the source, destination, headers, and/or content of the communications traffic.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network and between interconnected networks. Blocking or restricting detected harmful or suspicious communications between interconnected networks enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of traffic.

This requirement applies to the flow of information between the ALG when used as a gateway or boundary device which allows traffic flow between interconnected networks of differing security policies.

The ALG is installed and configured such that it restricts or blocks information flows based on guidance in the PPSM regarding restrictions for boundary crossing for ports, protocols and services. Information flow restrictions may be implemented based on attribute- and content-based inspection of the source, destination, headers, and/or content of the communications traffic.

The ALG must be configured with policy filters (e.g., security policy, rules, and/or signatures) that restrict or block information system services; provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information; and/or perform message-filtering based on message content. The policy filters used depends upon the type of application gateway (e.g., web, email, or TLS).</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Layer_Gateway_SRG/groups/V-204912">V-204912</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The ALG must immediately use updates made to policy enforcement mechanisms such as policy filters, rules, signatures, and analysis algorithms for gateway and/or intermediary functions.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Information flow policies regarding dynamic information flow control include, for example, allowing or disallowing information flows based on changes to the PPSM CAL, vulnerability assessments, or mission conditions.

The ALG must either send the alert to a management console that is actively monitored by authorized personnel or use a messaging capability to send the alert directly to designated personnel.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Layer_Gateway_SRG/groups/V-205024">V-205024</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The ALG that implements spam protection mechanisms must be updated automatically.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Originators of spam messages are constantly changing their techniques in order to defeat spam countermeasures; therefore, spam software must be constantly updated to address the changing threat.

This results in unanticipated application behavior potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

Network devices with the functionality to perform application layer inspection may be leveraged to validate data content of network communications. Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If network elements use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

This policy only applies to ALGs (e.g., identity management or authentication gateways) that provide user account services as part of the intermediary services.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Application_Layer_Gateway_SRG/groups/V-205058">V-205058</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The ALG providing user access control intermediary services must conceal, via the session lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system, but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.

The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. The network element session lock event must include an obfuscation of the display screen so as to prevent other users from reading what was previously displayed.

Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images, for example, patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, a clock, a battery life indicator, or a blank screen, with the additional caveat that none of the images convey sensitive information.

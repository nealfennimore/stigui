Traffic that is prohibited by the PPSM and Vulnerability Assessments must be denied by the policies configured in the Palo Alto Networks security platform; this is addressed in a separate requirement.

While auditing and logging are closely related, they are not the same. Logging is recording data about events that take place in a system, while auditing is the use of log records to identify security-relevant information such as system or user accesses. In short, log records are audited to establish an accurate history. Without logging, it would be impossible to establish an audit trail.

Palo Alto Networks security platform has four options for the source of log records - &quot;FQDN&quot;, &quot;hostname&quot;, &quot;ipv4-address&quot;, and &quot;ipv6-address&quot;.

The logs should identify what servers, destination addresses, applications, or databases were potentially attacked by logging communications traffic between the target and the attacker. All commands that were entered by the attacker (such as account creations, changes in permissions, files accessed, etc.) during the session should also be logged when capturing for forensic analysis.

Packet captures of attack traffic can be used by forensic tools for analysis for example, to determine if an alert is real or a false alarm or for forensics for threat intelligence. Configure the packet capture filters so that the CPU is not overloaded.  There are many reasons for a packet capture. This requirement addresses the case where the capture is based on forensics for a detected malicious attack and the traffic is being captured in association with that traffic. Filtering should be engaged to facilitate forensics.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/Palo_Alto_Networks_IDPS_STIG/groups/V-207691">V-207691</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300">medium</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">In the event of a logging failure caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the Palo Alto Networks security platform must continue generating and storing audit records if possible, overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.</td><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">It is critical that when the Palo Alto Networks security platform is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required, it takes action to mitigate the failure.

Installation of Palo Alto Networks security platform detection and prevention components (i.e., sensors) at key boundaries in the architecture mitigates the risk of DoS attacks. These attacks can be detected by matching observed communications traffic with patterns of known attacks and monitoring for anomalies in traffic volume/type.

To comply with this requirement, the Palo Alto Networks security platform must inspect outbound traffic for indications of known and unknown DoS attacks. Sensor log capacity management along with techniques which prevent the logging of redundant information during an attack also guard against DoS attacks. This requirement is used in conjunction with other requirements which require configuration of security policies, signatures, rules, and anomaly detection techniques and are applicable to both inbound and outbound traffic.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/Palo_Alto_Networks_IDPS_STIG/groups/V-207693">V-207693</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300">medium</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">The Palo Alto Networks security platform must detect and deny any prohibited mobile or otherwise malicious code at the enclave boundary.</td><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">Mobile code is defined as software modules obtained from remote systems, transferred across a network, and then downloaded and executed on a local system without explicit installation or execution by the recipient.

The Palo Alto Networks security platform allows customized profiles to be used to perform antivirus inspection for traffic between zones. Antivirus, anti-spyware, and vulnerability protection features require a specific license. There is a default Antivirus Profile; the profile inspects all of the listed protocol decoders for viruses, and generates alerts for SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 protocols while dropping for FTP, HTTP, and SMB protocols. However, these default actions cannot be edited and the values for the FTP, HTTP, and SMB protocols do not meet the requirement, so customized profiles must be used.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/Palo_Alto_Networks_IDPS_STIG/groups/V-207696">V-207696</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300">medium</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">The Palo Alto Networks security platform must send an immediate (within seconds) alert to, at a minimum, the SA when malicious code is detected.</td><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">Without an alert, security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and the ability to perform forensic analysis and detect rate-based and other anomalies will be impeded.

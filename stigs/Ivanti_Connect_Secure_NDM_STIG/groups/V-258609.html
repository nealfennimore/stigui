Valid factors include something the individual knows (e.g., username and password), something the individual has (e.g., a smartcard or token), or something the individual is (e.g., a fingerprint or biometric). Legacy information system environments only use a single factor for authentication, typically a username and password combination. Although two pieces of data are used in a username and password combination, this is still considered single factor because an attacker can obtain access simply by learning what the user knows. Common attacks against single-factor authentication are attacks on user passwords. These attacks include brute force password guessing, password spraying, and password credential stuffing. MFA, along with strong user account hygiene, helps mitigate against the threat of having account passwords discovered by an attacker. Even in the event of a password compromise, with MFA implemented and required for interactive login, the attacker still needs to acquire something the user has or replicate a piece of user&#x27;s biometric digital presence.

Private industry recognizes and uses a wide variety of MFA solutions. However, DOD public key infrastructure (PKI) is the only prescribed method approved for DOD organizations to implement MFA. For authentication purposes, centralized DOD certificate authorities (CA) issue PKI certificate key pairs (public and private) to individuals using the prescribed x.509 format. The private certificates that have been generated by the issuing CA are downloaded and saved to smartcards which, within DOD, are referred to as common access cards (CAC) or personal identity verification (PIV) cards. This happens at designated DOD badge facilities. The CA maintains a record of the corresponding public keys for use with PKI-enabled environments. Privileged user smartcards, or &quot;alternate tokens&quot;, function in the same manner, so this requirement applies to all interactive user sessions (authorized and privileged users).

Note: This requirement is used in conjunction with the use of a centralized authentication server (e.g., AAA, RADIUS, LDAP), a separate but equally important requirement. The MFA configuration of this requirement provides identification and the first phase of authentication (the challenge and validated response, thereby confirming the PKI certificate that was presented by the user). The centralized authentication server will provide the second phase of authentication (the digital presence of the PKI ID as a valid user in the requested security domain) and authorization. The centralized authentication server will map validated PKI identities to valid user accounts and determine access levels for authenticated users based on security group membership and role.

22. Under filter, use this specific attribute configuration: userPrincipalName=&lt;USER&gt;
23. Under group membership, add the base DN of where admin users that will access, using this as an example format: OU=IVANTI,DC=dod,DC=mil
24. Under filter use the following: cn=&lt;GROUPNAME&gt;
25. Under member attribute use the following: member.
26. Click &quot;Save Changes&quot;.
27. In the same LDAP server configuration screen, scroll down and click the &quot;Server Catalog&quot; hyperlink.
28. Under attributes, click New, Type: userPrincipalName, and save the changes.
29. Under groups, click Search. In the search box, type the group name used for admin logins.
30. Check the box next to the group that is found and click &quot;Add Selected&quot;.
31. Repeat these steps for all various groups needed for various roles on the ICS system. For example, groups for auditors, ISSOs, NOC, SOC, Viewer, etc.
32. Click &quot;Save Changes&quot;.

In the ICS Web UI, navigate to Administrators &gt;&gt; Admin Realms.
1. Click the admin realm being used. By default, &quot;Admin Users&quot; is defined.
2. Under servers, go to Authentication and select the certificate authentication realm created that included the customized User template of &lt;certAttr.altname.UPN&gt;
3. Under Directory/Attribute, select the previously created LDAP server.
4. Check the box for &quot;Enable dynamic policy evaluation&quot;.
5. Check both &quot;Refresh roles&quot; and &quot;refresh resource policies&quot;.
6. Click &quot;Save Changes&quot;.
7. Go to the Role Mapping tab.
8. Click &quot;New Rule&quot;.
9. Select &quot;Rule based on Group Membership&quot;, click &quot;Update&quot;.
10. Type a name for this rule.
11. Select &quot;is&quot;.
12. Type the group name exactly as it appears as the CN LDAP attribute.
13. Select the role. The default is &quot;.Administrators&quot; for ICS admins.
NOTE: if other roles for access to ICS management are needed, this can be configured in the Administrators &gt;&gt; Admin Roles section.
14. Click &quot;Save Changes&quot;.

In the ICS Web UI, navigate to Authentication &gt;&gt; Sign-in &gt;&gt; Sign-in Policies.
1. Create a New URL or edit the */admin/ URL - depending on the site.
NOTE: it is recommended to create a new sign-in URL until this configuration is fully tested to ensure there is still web UI reachability in the troubleshooting process.
2. Under authentication realm, click the &quot;User picks from a list of authentication realms&quot;.
3. Click &quot;Save Changes&quot;.

Test and verify the connection with CAC/Alt Token and LDAPS by attempting a web UI login using the token or CAC and entering the sign-in URL.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><!--/$--></main><footer class="row-start-3 flex gap-6 flex-wrap items-center justify-center"></footer></div><footer class="bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900

The centralized authentication server will provide the second phase of authentication (the digital presence of the PKI ID as a valid user in the requested security domain) and authorization. The centralized authentication server will map validated PKI identities to valid user accounts and determine access levels for authenticated users based on security group membership and role. In cases where the centralized authentication server is not utilized by the network device for user authorization, the network device must map the authenticated identity to the user account for PKI-based authentication."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:{\"metadata\":[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"STIGs | Ivanti Connect Secure NDM Security Technical Implementation Guide | The ICS must be configured to use DOD PKI as multifactor authentication (MFA) for interactive logins.\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$16\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"application-name\",\"content\":\"STIGUI\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"name\":\"keywords\",\"content\":\"V-258609,C-62349r930513_chk,F-62258r930514_fix,high,IVCS-NM-000320\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"name\":\"creator\",\"content\":\"DISA\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"name\":\"publisher\",\"content\":\"DISA\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"STIGs | Ivanti Connect Secure NDM Security Technical Implementation Guide | The ICS must be configured to use DOD PKI as multifactor authentication (MFA) for interactive logins.\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$17\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://stigui.com/stigs/Ivanti_Connect_Secure_NDM_STIG/groups/V-258609\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"STIGUI\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"article\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"article:published_time\",\"content\":\"2024-09-16T00:00:00.000Z\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"article:author\",\"content\":\"DISA\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"property\":\"article:tag\",\"content\":\"V-258609\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"property\":\"article:tag\",\"content\":\"C-62349r930513_chk\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"property\":\"article:tag\",\"content\":\"F-62258r930514_fix\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"property\":\"article:tag\",\"content\":\"high\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"17\",{\"property\":\"article:tag\",\"content\":\"IVCS-NM-000320\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"18\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"19\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"STIGs | Ivanti Connect Secure NDM Security Technical Implementation Guide | The ICS must be configured to use DOD PKI as multifactor authentication (MFA) for interactive logins.\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"20\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$18\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"21\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]],\"error\":null,\"digest\":\"$undefined\"}\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"b:{\"metadata\":\"$11:metadata\",\"error\":null,\"digest\":\"$undefined\"}\n"])</script></body></html>

16:T572,Voice phone services are critical to the effective operation of the DOD mission. Phone service must be available an emergency, such as a security breach or life safety event. The ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained.

While the DOD voice networks are designed to be extremely reliable to support COOP, a site could be cut off from the DOD network. Therefore, each physical site must maintain local commercial phone service. While this works to maintain local emergency service availability for security and life safety emergencies, it also provides the capability to make calls between DOD sites using the commercial network. An additional, non-IA benefit is that this supports the ability to make local calls without having to pay toll charges to call a local number via some distant regional access point. Local phone service can be delivered in a number of ways, all of which meet this requirement, while some of them must meet additional requirements to secure them.

Delivery options are as follows:
- PRI or CAS TDM trunks.
- Analog phone lines.

The following are some examples:
- A large site may use PRI, CAS, or POTS analog trunks connected to the site's PBX.
- A small site or office attached to a large site.
    - May have a PBX and be served similar to a large site.
    - May be served by several analog phone lines terminated on Voice Video Endpoints.17:T572,Voice phone services are critical to the effective operation of the DOD mission.

Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.

Confidentiality is not an objective of DNS, but integrity is.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records. 

The DoD has defined the list of events for which the application will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:

Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric.

This requirement applies to hardware/software diagnostic test equipment or tools. This requirement does not cover hardware/software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of the system (e.g., the software implementing &quot;ping,&quot; &quot;ls,&quot; &quot;ipconfig,&quot; or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch).

Lack of authentication enables anyone to gain access to the network or possibly a network element that provides opportunity for intruders to compromise resources within the network infrastructure. Network access control mechanisms interoperate to prevent unauthorized access and to enforce the organization&#x27;s security policy. Authorization for access to any network element requires an individual account identifier that has been approved, assigned, and configured on an authentication server.

In DNS, trust in the public key of the source is established by starting from a trusted name server and establishing the chain of trust down to the current source of response through successive verifications of signature of the public key of a child by its parent. 

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC). 

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor. A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate. In DNS, a trust anchor is a DNSKEY that is placed into a validating resolver so the validator can cryptographically validate the results for a given request back to a known public key (the trust anchor). 

An example means to indicate the security status of child subspaces is through the use of delegation signer (DS) resource records in the DNS.

Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Without path validation and a chain of trust, there can be no trust that the data integrity authenticity has been maintained during a transaction.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/DNS_SRG/groups/V-205178">V-205178</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The validity period for the RRSIGs covering the DS RR for a zones delegated children must be no less than two days and no more than one week.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">The best way for a zone administrator to minimize the impact of a key compromise is by limiting the validity period of RRSIGs in the zone and in the parent zone.

To prevent the impact of a compromised KSK, a delegating parent should set the signature validity period for RRSIGs covering DS RRs in the range of a few days to 1 week.

Application-specific examples of enforcement occurs in systems that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services or provide a message filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).

A DNS server is an example of an information system providing name/address resolution service. Digital signatures and cryptographic keys are examples of additional artifacts. DNS resource records are examples of authoritative data. Applications other than the DNS to map between host/service names and network addresses must provide other means to assure the authenticity and integrity of response data.

DNSSEC provides the means to verify integrity assurances for the host/service name to network address resolution information obtained through the service. By using the delegation signer (DS) resource records in the DNS, the security status of a child domain can be validated.  The DS resource record is used to identify the DNSSEC signing key of a delegated zone.

Starting from a trusted name server (such as the root name server) and down to the current source of response through successive verifications of signature of the public key of a child by its parent, the chain of trust is established. The public key of the trusted name servers is called the trust anchor. After authenticating the source, the next process DNSSEC calls for is to authenticate the response. This requires that responses consist of not only the requested RRs but also an authenticator associated with them. In DNSSEC, this authenticator is the digital signature of a Resource Record (RR) Set. The digital signature of an RRSet is encapsulated through a special RRType called RRSIG. The DNS client using the trusted public key of the source (whose trust has just been established) then verifies the digital signature to detect if the response is valid or bogus.

This control enables the DNS to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the host/service name to network address resolution information obtained through the service.  Without indication of the security status of a child domain and enabling verification of a chain of trust, integrity and availability of the DNS infrastructure cannot be assured.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/DNS_SRG/groups/V-205182">V-205182</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The DNS implementation must protect the authenticity of communications sessions for zone transfers.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">DNS is a fundamental network service that is prone to various attacks, such as cache poisoning and man-in-the middle attacks.

Applications and application developers must take the steps needed to ensure users cannot use an authorized application to launch DoS attacks against other systems and networks. For example, applications may include mechanisms that throttle network traffic so users are not able to generate unlimited network traffic via the application. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks.

When it comes to DoS attacks, most of the attention is paid to ensuring that systems and applications are not victims of these attacks. A DoS attack against the DNS infrastructure has the potential to cause a denial of service to all network users. As the DNS is a distributed backbone service of the Internet, numerous forms of attacks result in DoS, and they are still prevalent on the Internet today. Some potential DoS attacks against the DNS include malformed packet flood, spoofed source addresses, and distributed DoS, and the DNS can be exploited to launch amplification attacks upon other systems.

While it is true that those accountable for systems want to ensure they are not affected by a DoS attack, they also need to ensure their systems and applications are not used to launch such an attack against others. To that end, a variety of technologies exist to limit the effects of DoS attacks, such as careful configuration of resolver and recursion functionality.

DNS administrators must take the steps needed to ensure other systems and tools cannot use exploits to launch DoS attacks against other systems and networks.

Configuring the DNS implementation to defend against cache poisoning, employing increased capacity and bandwidth, building redundancy into the DNS architecture, utilizing DNSSEC, limiting and securing recursive services, DNS black holes, etc., may reduce the susceptibility to some flooding types of DoS attacks.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/DNS_SRG/groups/V-205191">V-205191</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The DNS server implementation must check the validity of all data inputs except those specifically identified by the organization.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an application&#x27;s data entry fields and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application. 

Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

Attacks may be generated by entering invalid data into DNS transactions, in the hopes that the data will not be handled correctly and will allow a vulnerable condition to be exploited. To safeguard against this, all data entered in untrusted DNS transactions (e.g., DNS queries from external hosts) should be checked for validity before being processed further.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/DNS_SRG/groups/V-205192">V-205192</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The DNS server implementation must, when a component failure is detected, activate a notification to the system administrator.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Predictable failure prevention requires organizational planning to address system failure issues.

Once a name server has been poisoned, legitimate clients may be directed to non-existent hosts (which constitutes a denial of service), or, worse, hosts that masquerade as legitimate ones to obtain sensitive data or passwords. 

To guard against poisoning, name servers authoritative for .mil domains should be separated functionally from name servers that resolve queries on behalf of internal clients. Organizations may achieve this separation by dedicating machines to each function or, if possible, by running two instances of the name server software on the same machine: one for the authoritative function and the other for the resolving function. In this design, each name server process may be bound to a different IP address or network interface to implement the required segregation.

DNSSEC ensures that the answer received when querying for name resolution actually comes from a trusted name server. Since DNSSEC is still far from being globally deployed external to DoD, and many resolvers either haven‚Äôt been updated or don‚Äôt support DNSSEC, maintaining cached zone data separate from authoritative zone data mitigates the gap until all DNS data is validated with DNSSEC. 

Since DNS forwarding of queries can be accomplished in some DNS applications without caching locally, DNS forwarding is the method to be used when providing external DNS resolution to internal clients.   </td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/DNS_SRG/groups/V-205203">V-205203</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The DNS server implementation must authenticate the other DNS server before responding to a server-to-server transaction.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Without authenticating devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be introduced, thereby facilitating malicious activity.

The salt value should be changed every time the entire zone is re-signed.

An attacker that has compromised a KSK can use that key for only as long as the signature interval of the RRSIG covering the DS RR in the delegating parent. These validity periods should be short, which will require frequent re-signing.

To minimize the impact of a compromised ZSK, a zone administrator should set a signature validity period of 1 week for RRSIGs covering the DNSKEY RRSet in the zone (the RRSet that contains the ZSK and KSK for the zone). The DNSKEY RRSet can be re-signed without performing a ZSK rollover, but scheduled ZSK rollover should still be performed at regular intervals.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/DNS_SRG/groups/V-205229">V-205229</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">NSEC3 must be used for all internal DNS zones.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">To ensure that RRs associated with a query are really missing in a zone file and have not been removed in transit, the DNSSEC mechanism provides a means for authenticating the nonexistence of an RR. It generates a special RR called an NSEC (or NSEC3) RR that lists the RRTypes associated with an owner name as well as the next name in the zone file. It sends this special RR, along with its signatures, to the resolving name server. By verifying the signature, a DNSSEC-aware resolving name server can determine which authoritative owner name exists in a zone and which authoritative RRTypes exist at those owner names.

IETF&#x27;s design criteria consider DNS data to be public. Confidentiality is not one of the security goals of DNSSEC. DNSSEC is not designed to directly protect against denial-of-service threats but does so indirectly by providing message integrity and source authentication. An artifact of how DNSSEC performs negative responses allows a client to map all the names in a zone (zone walking). 

A zone which contains zone data that the administrator does not want to be made public should use the NSEC3 RR option for providing authenticated denial of existence.



If DNSSEC is enabled for a server, the ability to verify a particular server which may attempt to update the DNS server actually exists. This is done through the use of NSEC3 records to provide an &quot;authenticated denial of existence&quot; for specific systems whose addresses indicate that they lie within a particular zone.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/DNS_SRG/groups/V-205230">V-205230</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The DNS implementation must ensure each NS record in a zone file points to an active name server authoritative for the domain specified in that record.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Poorly constructed NS records pose a security risk because they create conditions under which an adversary might be able to provide the missing authoritative name services that are improperly specified in the zone file.

The public key of the trusted zone is called the trust anchor. After authenticating the source, the next process DNSSEC calls for is to authenticate the response.

* Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
* RSA
* Elliptic Curve DSA (ECDSA).
Of these three algorithms, RSA and DSA are more widely available and hence are considered candidates of choice for DNSSEC. In terms of performance, both RSA and DSA have comparable signature generation speeds, but DSA is much slower for signature verification. Hence, RSA is the recommended algorithm as far as this guideline is concerned. RSA with SHA-1 is currently the only cryptographic algorithm mandated to be implemented with DNSSEC, although other algorithm suites (i.e. RSA/SHA-256, ECDSA) are also specified. It can be expected that name servers and clients will be able to use the RSA algorithm at the minimum. It is suggested that at least one ZSK for a zone use the RSA algorithm.
NIST&#x27;s Secure Hash Standard (SHS) (FIPS 180-3) specifies SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 as approved hash algorithms to be used as part of the algorithm suite for generating digital signatures using the digital signature algorithms in NIST&#x27;s DSS[FIPS186]. It is expected that there will be support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography in the DNSSEC.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. In a DNS implementation, DAC should be granted to a minimal number of individuals and objects because DNS does not interact directly with users and users do not store and share data with the DNS application directly.

The primary objective of DNS authentication and access control is the integrity of DNS records; only authorized personnel must be able to create and modify resource records, and name servers should only accept updates from authoritative master servers for the relevant zones. Integrity is best assured through authentication and access control features within the name server software and the file system the name server resides on. In order to protect the zone files and configuration data, which should only be accessed by the name service or an administrator, access controls need to be implemented on files, and rights should not be easily propagated to other users. Lack of a stringent access control policy places the DNS infrastructure at risk to malicious persons and attackers, in addition to potential denial of service to network resources.

DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit, resulting in unauthorized access to said objects.

When applications provide a DAC mechanism, the DNS implementation must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/DNS_SRG/groups/V-205242">V-205242</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The DNS implementation must implement internal/external role separation.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">DNS servers with an internal role only process name/address resolution requests from within the organization (i.e., internal clients).

The recommendation is to configure authoritative servers to refuse to answer queries for any zones for which they are not authoritative.

The process of authenticating the source of a message and its integrity through hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC) is specified through a set of DNS specifications known collectively as TSIG. The sender of the message uses the HMAC function to generate a MAC and sends this MAC along with the message to the receiver. The receiver, who shares the same secret key, uses the key and HMAC function used by the sender to compute the MAC on the received message. The receiver then compares the computed MAC with the received MAC; if the two values match, it provides assurance that the message has been received correctly and that the sender belongs to the community of users sharing the same secret key.

Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, such as clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentications depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support the

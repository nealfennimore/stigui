16:Taa4,Finding unauthorized and/or improperly configured wireless devices (PEDs) connected to and/or operating on the SIPRNet is a security incident and could directly result in the loss or compromise of classified or sensitive information either intentionally or accidentally. 

An assessment of risk in accordance with the Risk Management Framework (RMF) along with Certification and Accreditation and an Authorization to Operate (ATO) must be  accomplished and documented prior to connecting NSA approved classified PED solutions on a classified network such as SIPRNet or using PEDs within a classified enclave.

A key requirement is that classified PEDs used to store classified data must comply with either the NSA Data At Rest (DAR) Capability Package and associated Risk Assessment or achieve NSA approval as a Tailored Solution for protection of data at rest.

Handling procedures should include guidance provided in NSA risk assessments and may involve two layers of National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP)-approved DAR protection, shipping/storage in accordance with Reference (a), and programmed data wiping or certificate revocation.

16:T48d,Unneeded but running services offer attackers an enhanced attack profile, and attackers are constantly watching to discover open ports with running services. By analyzing and disabling unneeded services, the associated open ports become unresponsive to outside queries, and servers become more secure as a result.

Exchange Server has role-based server deployment to enable protocol path control and logical separation of network traffic types.

For example, a server implemented in the Client Access role (i.e., Outlook Web App [OWA]) is configured and tuned as a web server using web protocols. A client access server exposes only web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS), enabling system administrators to optimize the protocol path and disable all services unnecessary for Exchange web services.

Similarly, servers created to host mailboxes are dedicated to that task and must operate only the services needed for mailbox hosting. (Exchange servers must also operate some web services but only to the degree that Exchange requires the IIS engine in order to function).

Because POP3 and IMAP4 clients are not included in the standard desktop offering, they must be disabled.17:T48d,Unneeded but running services offer attackers an enhanced attack profile, and attackers are constantly watching to discover open ports with running services.

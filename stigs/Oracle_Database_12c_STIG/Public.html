If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and non-repudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to digitally sign documents and can pretend to be the authorized user.

Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys.

All access to the private key of the DBMS must be restricted to authorized and authenticated users. If unauthorized users have access to the DBMS’s private key, an attacker could gain access to the primary key and use it to impersonate the database on the network.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Although the Oracle configuration parameters have names including &#x27;SSL&#x27;, such as SSL_VERSION and SSL_CIPHER_SUITES, they refer to TLS.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Oracle_Database_12c_STIG/groups/V-220265">V-220265</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The system must employ automated mechanisms for supporting Oracle user account management.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers.

Enterprise environments make application user account management challenging and complex.  A user management process requiring administrators to manually address account management functions adds risk of potential oversight.

Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization&#x27;s automated account management requirements.

Databases can have large numbers of users in disparate locations and job functions. Automatic account management can help mitigate the risk of human error found in manually managing database access.

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible. Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP. This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Oracle_Database_12c_STIG/groups/V-220266">V-220266</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The DBMS must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to the system in accordance with applicable policy.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Strong access controls are critical to securing application data. Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) must be employed by applications, when applicable, to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system.

FIPS 140-2 modules can remain active for up to five years after validation or until September 21, 2026, when the FIPS 140-2 validations will be moved to the historical list. Even on the historical list, CMVP supports the purchase and use of these modules for existing systems. While Federal Agencies decide when they move to FIPS 140-3 only modules, purchasers are reminded that for several years there may be a limited selection of FIPS 140-3 modules from which to choose.

If the application were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement is contingent upon the language in which the application is programmed, as many application architectures in use today incorporate their software libraries into, and make them inseparable from, their compiled distributions, rendering them static and version-dependent. However, this requirement does apply to applications with software libraries accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.

Organizations define which application components shall provide auditable events.

The DBMS must provide auditing for the list of events defined by the organization or risk negatively impacting forensic investigations into malicious behavior in the information system. Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system, such as network interfaces, hard disks, modems, etc. From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited, as well.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked).

Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for determining which application components shall provide auditable events.

Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the DBMS configuration or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability.

The Department of Defense has established the following as the minimum set of auditable events. Most can be audited via Oracle settings; some - marked here with an asterisk - cannot, and may require OS settings.
- Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g. classification levels).
- Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system level access
- Starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations.
- Successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects.
- All program initiations.

Applications providing tools to interface with audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the access to audit tools.

Audit tools include, but are not limited to, OS-provided audit tools, vendor-provided audit tools, and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records.

If an attacker were to gain access to audit tools, he could analyze audit logs for system weaknesses or weaknesses in the auditing itself.  An attacker could also manipulate logs to hide evidence of malicious activity.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Oracle_Database_12c_STIG/groups/V-220283">V-220283</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Database objects must be owned by accounts authorized for ownership.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Within the database, object ownership implies full privileges to the owned object including the privilege to assign access to the owned objects to other subjects.

Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.

Database Management Systems that do not validate certificates to a trust anchor are in danger of accepting certificates that are invalid and/or counterfeit. This could allow unauthorized access to the database.

Session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user&#x27;s session.

Unique session identifiers or IDs are the opposite of sequentially generated session IDs, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attackers are unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions.

Some default DBMS error messages can contain information that could aid an attacker in, among others things, identifying the database type, host address, or state of the database.

DAC is a type of access control methodology serving as a means of restricting access to objects and data based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. It is discretionary in the sense that application users with the appropriate permissions to access an application resource or data have the discretion to pass that permission on to another user either directly or indirectly.

Data protection requirements may result in a DAC policy being specified as part of the application design. Discretionary access controls would be employed at the application level to restrict and control access to application objects and data thereby providing increased information security for the organization.

When DAC controls are employed, those controls must limit sharing to named application users, groups of users, or both. The application DAC controls must also limit the propagation of access rights and have the ability to exclude access to data down to the granularity of a single user.

Databases using DAC must have the ability for the owner of an object or information to assign or revoke rights to view or modify the object or information.

DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit, resulting in unauthorized access to said objects.

When applications provide a discretionary access control mechanism, the application must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.

The DBMS must ensure the recipient of permissions possesses only the access intended. The database must enforce the ability to limit rights propagation if that is the intent of the grantor.

In order to assure availability of this data in the event of a system failure, DoD organizations are required to ensure user-generated data is backed up at a defined frequency. This includes data stored on file systems, within databases or within any other storage media.

Applications performing backups must be capable of backing up user-level information per the DoD-defined frequency.

Lost or compromised DBMS backup and restoration files may lead to not only the loss of data, but also the unauthorized access to sensitive data. Backup files need the same protections against unauthorized access when stored on backup media as when online and actively in use by the database system. In addition, the backup media needs to be protected against physical loss. Most DBMS&#x27;s maintain online copies of critical control files to provide transparent or easy recovery from hard disk loss or other interruptions to database operation.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Oracle_Database_12c_STIG/groups/V-237724">V-237724</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The DBMS must ensure users are authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a shared authenticator.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">To assure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) must be individually identified and authenticated.

A shared authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a shared authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. An example of a shared authenticator is the UNIX OS &#x27;root&#x27; user account, a Windows &#x27;administrator&#x27; account, an &#x27;SA&#x27; account, or a &#x27;helpdesk&#x27; account.

For example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a &#x27;switch user&#x27; capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, &#x27;switch&#x27; to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a shared authenticator.

Some applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a shared authenticator, this requirement will apply.

There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information. These types of accesses are allowed but must be explicitly identified and documented by the organization.

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/Oracle_Database_12c_STIG/groups/V-237725">V-237725</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The DBMS must disable user accounts after 35 days of inactivity.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Attackers that are able to exploit an inactive DBMS account can potentially obtain and maintain undetected access to the database. 

Owners of inactive DBMS accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. All DBMS need to track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be hijacked, leading to a data compromise.
 
To address access requirements, some database administrators choose to integrate their databases with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the database administrator to off-load those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality. 

This policy does not apply to either emergency accounts or infrequently used accounts. Infrequently used accounts are local logon administrator accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available. Emergency accounts are administrator accounts created in response to crisis situations.

When applications provide a remote management capability inherent to the application, the application needs to ensure all sessions and network connections are terminated when non-local maintenance is completed.

When network connections are left open after the database session has closed, the network session is open to session hijacking.

When these types of accounts are created, there is a risk that the temporary account may remain in place and active after the support representative has left.

In the event emergency application accounts are required, the application must ensure accounts that are designated as temporary in nature shall automatically terminate these accounts after an organization-defined time period.  Such a process and capability greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be misused, hijacked, or application data compromised.

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP. This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

If it is possible for any temporary emergency accounts to be created and managed by Oracle, then the DBMS or application must provide or utilize a mechanism to automatically terminate such accounts after an organization-defined time period.

If the application were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement is contingent upon the language in which the application is programmed, as many application architectures in use today incorporate their software libraries into, and make them inseparable from, their compiled distributions, rendering them static and version-dependent. However, this requirement does apply to applications with software libraries accessible and configurable as in the case of interpreted languages.

Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

The DBMS software libraries contain the executables used by the DBMS to operate. Unauthorized access to the libraries can result in malicious alteration.

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a document. 

Authentication via shared accounts does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users.

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.</td></tr></tbody></table></form></div></section><!--/$--></main><footer class="row-start-3 flex gap-6 flex-wrap items-center justify-center"></footer></div><footer class="bg-white

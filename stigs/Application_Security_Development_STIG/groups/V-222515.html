Vulnerability assessment tests normally utilize a combination of specialized software called application vulnerability scanners as well as custom scripts and manual tests.  In some instances, multiple tools are required in order to test all aspects of application features, functions and architecture.  The vulnerability scanner is typically configured to communicate with the application through the user interface or via an applications communication port.  In addition to using automated tools, manual tests conducted from the OS console such as executing custom scripts or reviewing configuration settings for known vulnerabilities may also be included as part of the test.

Testers will typically utilize application user test accounts in order to test application features and functionality such as adding content, executing queries and completing transactions. The vulnerability testing software utilizes user actions and access as well as a list of known security vulnerabilities in order to detect and identify weak security controls or misconfigurations that could potentially be manipulated by the user or create a security vulnerability.

Interview the application administrator, obtain and review their application vulnerability scanning process.

Request the latest scan results including scan configuration settings.

Review scan configurations and ensure coverage of all application architecture has been tested.  The proper scanning tool or combination of tools must be utilized in order to ensure the full range of application features and functionality is tested. 

For example, if the application includes a web interface and a SQL database, then ensure test results for web and SQL vulnerabilities are provided.  Although web and SQL applications are included as examples and are the prevalent types of applications, this requirement is not intended to be limited to just the aforementioned application architectures.   Ensure test results are provided from all testing tools employed during vulnerability testing.

If high risk security vulnerabilities are identified in the scan results, request subsequent test results that indicate the issues have been fixed or mitigated.

If the high risk issues identified in the report have not been fixed or mitigated to a level accepted by the ISSO and the ISSM, or if the application administrator cannot produce vulnerability security testing results that cover the range of application functionality, this is a finding.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section class="w-full flex flex-col"><div class="relative overflow-x-auto shadow-md sm:rounded-lg"><table class="w-full text-sm text-left rtl:text-right text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400"><thead class="text-xs text-zinc-700 uppercase bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-400"><tr><th scope="col" class="px-6 py-3">✔️ Fix</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="even:bg-white even:dark:bg-zinc-900 odd:bg-zinc-50 odd:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200 text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line"><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">Configure the application vulnerability scanners to test all components of the application, conduct vulnerability scans on a regular basis and remediate identified issues.

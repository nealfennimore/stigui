classified information that is not part of the communications session while the camera is active. This can happen if information in the form of charts, pictures, or maps are displayed on a wall within the viewing or capture range of a camera. Any pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ) capabilities of the camera must be considered. One may consider visual information out of range, but it may be in range considering camera capabilities such as high definition, PTZ, and video enhancement possibilities for captured frames. Inadvertent display of classified information could also happen if the information is lying on a desk or table unprotected.

NOTES: 
- Vulnerability awareness and operational training will be provided to users of VTC and video/collaboration communications-related cameras regarding these requirements.
- This requirement is relevant no matter what the classification level of the session. In an IP environment, the classification of VTC or PC communications depends on the classification of the network to which the VTU or PC is attached and the classification of the facility in which it is located. While classified communications can occur at the same level of classification as the network and facility, communications having a lower or no classification (e.g., unclassified or CUI) may also occur in the same environment. Therefore, sensitive or classified information that is not part of the communications session might be improperly disclosed without proper controls in place.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259893">V-259893</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300"><span>high</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">An IP-based VTC system implementing a single CODEC that supports conferences on multiple networks with different classification levels (i.e., unclassified, SECRET, TOP SECRET, TS-SCI) must support Periods Processing by connecting the CODEC to one network at a time, matching the classification level of the session to the classification level of the network.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Connecting to networks of different classifications simultaneously incurs the risk of data from a higher classification being released to a network of a lower classification, referred to as a &quot;spill&quot;.

One method for managing these packets is stateful packet inspection. This inspection minimally validates that the permitted packets are part of a known session.

If they are not properly managed, packets that are not part of a known session may traverse a pinhole, giving unauthorized access to the enclave&#x27;s LAN or connected hosts. Another method for managing packets through a pinhole opened for a VVoIP session is to only permit packets to pass matching the expected protocol type, such as RTP/RTCP or SRTP/SRTCP. If only RTP/RTCP or SRTP/SRTCP packets are permitted to pass, this reduces the exposure presented to the enclave by the open pinhole.

Additional flows or protocols may be permitted if specifically required for an approved function and establishment is signaled or controlled by the signaling protocol in use by the system. An example of this is the transmission of H.281 far end camera control messages for a video conferencing session. Using AS-SIP for signaling, a UDP-based 6.4kbps H.224 over RTP control channel over which the H.281 far end camera control messages are transmitted might be established along with the media streams. This additional flow would require additional pinholes.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259891">V-259891</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Policy must define operations for endpoint microphones regarding the ability to pick up and transmit sensitive information.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Microphones used with VTC systems and devices are designed to be extremely sensitive so the voice of anyone speaking anywhere within a conference room is picked up and amplified so they can be heard clearly and understood at the remote location on the call. This same sensitivity is included in VTUs that are used in office spaces. This has one disadvantage. The microphones can pick up sidebar conversations that have no relationship to the conference or call in progress. 

Likewise, in an open area, received conference audio can be broadcast to others in the area that are not part of the conference and possibly should not be exposed to the conference information for need-to-know reasons. Speakerphones exhibit a similar vulnerability. This is the same confidentiality vulnerability posed to audible sound information in the environment as discussed above, with the added twist that the conference audio is vulnerable to others in the environment. While this is more of an issue in environments where classified conversations normally occur, it is also an issue in any environment. This is of particularly concern in open work areas or open offices where multiple people work in near proximity. 

Users or operators of VTC systems of any type must take care regarding who can hear what is being said during a conference call and what unrelated conversations can be picked up by the sensitive microphone. Where a VTU is used by a single person in an open area, a partial mitigation for this could be the use of a headset with earphones and a microphone. While this would limit the ability of others to hear audio from the conference and could also limit the audio pickup of unrelated conversations, it may not be fully effective. 

In some instances, such as when a VTU is located in a SCIF, a Push-to-Talk (PTT) handset/headset may be required Microphones embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint, PC, or PC monitor can be sensitive enough to pick up sound that is not related to a given communications session. They could pick up nearby conversations and other sounds. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is not related to the communications in progress. Speakers embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint or PC can be made loud enough to be heard across a room or in the next workspace. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is being communicated during a session. 

Users must be aware of other conversations in the area and their sensitivity when using any communications endpoint (not only a PC-based voice, video, or collaboration communications application). This awareness must then translate into protecting or eliminating these other conversations. A short-range, reduced-gain, or noise-cancelling microphone may be required. A PTT microphone may also be required for classified areas. The microphone should be muted when the user is not speaking as both mitigation for this issue and proper etiquette when participating in a conference. The muting function should be performed using a positively controlled disconnect, shorting switch, or mechanism instead of a software-controlled mute function on the PC. 

Users must be aware of other people in the area that could hear what is being communicated. This is particularly an issue if the communicated information is sensitive or classified because the parties overhearing the information may not have proper clearance or a need-to-know. To mitigate this issue, a headset or speakers should be used and at a volume that only the user can hear.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259892">V-259892</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">An IP-based VTC system implementing a single CODEC that supports conferences on multiple networks with different classification levels (i.e., unclassified, SECRET, TOP SECRET, TS-SCI) must support Periods Processing by being sanitized of all information while transitioning from one period/network to the next.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">All residual data (data unintentionally left behind on computer media) must be cleared before transitioning from one period/network to the next.

This makes it difficult for someone to add unauthorized digital instruments to the system. However, this could be done more easily with older analog systems by tapping an existing analog line. 

With Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging, this is no longer the case. Most IPT/VoIP systems employ an automatic means of detecting and registering a new instrument on the network with the call management server and then downloading its configuration to the instrument. This presents a vulnerability whereby unauthorized instruments could be added to the system or instruments could be moved without authorization. Such activity can happen anywhere there is an active network port or outlet. 

This is not only a configuration management problem. It could also allow theft of services or some other malicious attack. It is recognized however, that auto-registration is necessary during large deployments of VoIP terminals, and for a short time thereafter, to facilitate additions and troubleshooting. This applies to initial system setup and any subsequent large redeployments or additions. Normal, day-to-day moves, adds, and changes will require manual registration. Because it may be possible for an unauthorized VoIP terminal to be added to the system easily during auto-registration, the registration logs must be compared to the authorized terminal inventory. 

Alternately, the system could have a method of automatically registering only preauthorized terminals. This feature would support VoIP terminals that are AO approved for connection from multiple local or remote locations. It is critical to the security of the system that all IPT/VoIP end instruments be authorized to connect to and use the system. Only authorized instruments should be configured in the system controller and therefore allowed to operate. Unauthorized instruments could lead to system compromise or abuse. A manual inventory of authorized end instruments will aid in the detection of unauthorized instruments registered to the system, particularly during the period when autodetection/registration is permitted. This will also aid in certification and accreditation efforts.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259905">V-259905</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Voice networks must not be bridged via a Unified Capability (UC) soft client accessory.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">While a headset, microphone, or webcam can be considered to be UC soft client accessories, these are also accessories for other collaboration and communications applications. 

This discussion relates to UC soft client-specific accessories, which consist of USB phones, USB ATAs, and PPGs. A USB phone is a physical USB-connected telephone instrument that associates itself with the UC soft client application running on the PC. It minimally provides a handset that includes both the mouthpiece and receiver and may provide a dial pad, a speakerphone function, or other functions. They should be operated accordingly. 

A USB ATA is a USB-connected device that associates itself with the UC soft client application and provides the ability to use a standard analog telephone or speakerphone. Some USB ATAs also provide a port to which an analog phone line can be connected. This allows a single analog phone to be used with the UC soft client while also answering and placing calls via the analog phone line. This line could be connected to a local PBX or to the PSTN. Some USB phones contain a port to which an analog phone line can be connected so the USB phone can be used with it to place and receive calls. There is little risk in the operation of this kind of USB ATA or USB phone, providing it operates only as described and there is no direct bridging of networks as described next. 

A PPG (USB connected or internal card) is a type of ATA that is a gateway intended to bridge the UC soft client application and supporting VVoIP network to an analog phone line from a local PBX or the PSTN. PPGs pose legal and fraud threats to a DOD network due to this bridging of networks. They can be used for toll fraud, toll avoidance, or placing or receiving unauthorized calls. Some USB phones can contain a PPG. While these devices might be used to meet a specific mission requirement, their use may be illegal in certain countries and instances when connected between a DOD IP voice and data network and a public dial-up voice network. The use of any UC soft client accessory that provides a network bridging function poses both a legal and an IA threat to the DOD voice communications network. PPGs must not be used except to fulfill a validated and approved mission requirement.

While this degrades the protections afforded a hardware-based system, the trend is to use more and more PC-based communications applications due to their advanced features, collaborative benefits, and perceived reduced cost. This soft-phone use case results in the elimination of hardware-based telephones on users&#x27; desks in the workplace. This can be seen as, or result in, trading down (from a hardware-based system) with regard to availability, reliability, and quality of service because the data network is generally more susceptible to compromise from many sources inside and outside the local LAN, making the soft-phones more exposed to attack. 

This also means no telephone will be available in the workspace if the PC is not powered on, the application is not loaded, or the PC is not fully functional. While this is undesirable from an IA standpoint, a business case can be developed to support it. 

NOTE: The recommended relationship between PC soft-phone/UC applications and hardware-based endpoints in the normal work area is that the PC application should augment the functionality of, or be a backup to, the hardware-based instrument in the user&#x27;s workspace. The implementation of PC soft-phones or UC applications in the user workspace as their only endpoint has several ramifications that must be considered. These include: 

- The PC becomes a single point of failure for communications services provided to a user in their workspace. A widespread problem, which affects many PCs or the network infrastructure, may disable all communications for many users at one time. Users may not have a means to report the failure without using an alternate communications system. A fast-spreading worm or power outage could create such a situation. While some may argue that &quot;users can call on their cell phones&quot;, service may not be available, or their use may not be permitted in the facility. This translates into the loss of functionality and efficiency, as in lost time, due to the inability to communicate when the PC or soft-phone application is not running or functioning properly.

- The protections afforded hardware-based endpoints by the use of the voice protection zone, such as VoIP VLAN(s) and others, are missing for soft-phones in a widespread use/implementation scenario and, depending on the implementation on the PC, may degrade the protections afforded hardware-based endpoints. Such is the case for all software-based communications endpoints because they are typically implemented on all PCs and therefore will be connected to the data VLANs. Assured service for voice traffic will be degraded from that obtained with hardware-based instruments connected in the voice protection zone. This translates into the following additional IA measures required to protect the VoIP infrastructure (e.g., a firewall between the VoIP and data VLANs):
 
- The hardware-based endpoint is not available for use in parallel with, or in place of, the PC. This can be a problem if the PC is having performance or operational issues, is turned off, or is unavailable. Accessing help desk services requiring logging on to the PC to use the voice services and work on a problem could be a real challenge. Rebooting the PC to clear a problem would disconnect the call to the helpdesk. Accessing voice mail or answering the phone while the PC is booting is made impossible, reducing efficiency, particularly when the user starts their day. If the user has command and control (C2) responsibilities, the IP equivalent of MLPP cannot function properly if an application or PC is unavailable. Precedence calls will not be received by the user but will be transferred to their designated alternate answering point. 

- Emergency communications could be unavailable if the PC is not booted, the communications application is not running, or either is otherwise compromised. Voice communications must be readily available for life safety and medical reasons, as well as other facility security emergencies. A partial mitigation for this in a &quot;soft-phone world&quot; is to place common use hardware telephones within a short distance (e.g., 30 to 50 feet) of every workspace, which is an additional cost. This additional distance, however, could be an issue in a medical emergency where a worker might be alone in their workspace and their PC or voice communications application is not functioning properly. They may not be able to reach the common use instrument depending on the nature of the medical emergency. If the worker was suffering a heart attack or diabetic emergency, they could die. Business cases therefore need to include the cost of insurance and/or lawsuits for this eventuality. 

The previous two items translate into the following the addition of common-use hardware-based instruments placed around the facility (for backup and emergency use) along with the additionally required LAN cabling and access switch ports. While some may believe this is not an IA issue, it is because the discussion is about availability, which is one of the prime tenets of IA. 

Additionally, the VoIP controllers (i.e., the equipment that controls the telephone system) must be able to be accessed by the PC soft-phones while being protected as they would be in a normal VoIP system using hardware-based instruments. 

NOTE: Methods for permitting the necessary PC traffic to, from, and between the voice and data zones while protecting the voice zone will be discussed later in this document.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259907">V-259907</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Implementing Unified Capabilities (UC) soft clients as the primary voice endpoint must have authorizing official (AO) approval.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">The AO responsible for the implementation of a voice system that uses UC soft clients for its endpoints must be made aware of the risks and benefits.

This means there is a validated mission need and the number of UC soft clients permitted to operate inside the LAN will be less than the number of hardware-based phones in the LAN. This number should be limited to UC soft clients required to meet specific mission requirements. 

There are scenarios for the use of limited numbers of UC soft clients in the strategic LAN. The first of these scenarios is providing support for UC soft clients associated with a VoIP system in another enclave. This is a remote access scenario and must operate as they would in a normal remote access use case. If this scenario is approved, special accommodations must be made in the local LAN to support users from a remote LAN and permit them to connect to their home enclave. This could include segregating them on a separate dedicated LAN with its own boundary protection or by implementing a dedicated VLAN protection zone while opening the enclave boundary to permit the remote connection. 

Voice/video and data must reside on separate VLANs for the protection of the voice infrastructure. However, recognizing that requiring a NIC to be configured to support voice/video and data VLANs is not a viable solution, voice and data traffic can coexist in the data VLAN when leaving the workstation. Based on the Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) that UC application tag its signaling and media traffic with the proper UCR-defined Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP), the LAN access switch port can route the UC traffic to the voice/video VLAN. If the LAN access switch is not capable, then routing upstream must perform this. A separate NIC is not required to support VLANs for voice and video segmentation under UC.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259909">V-259909</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">A Call Center or Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) system using soft clients must be segregated into a protected enclave and limit traffic traversing the boundary.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">UC soft clients may be used on a strategic LAN when associated with or part of a CTI application. Traditional computer telephony integration CTI encompasses the control of a telephone or telecommunications switch by a computer application. Interfaces have been developed to provide connection between the computer, typically a workstation, and the telephone or other terminal attached to the telephone switch, and possibly a special analog or TDM line going directly to the telephone switch. 

Applications are also developed to use these interfaces to integrate a data application with the telephone system. Sometimes the integration is as simple as being able to dial a number from the computer application, or it could provide full control of the switch as in the case of an operator&#x27;s console. 

In these traditional scenarios, the voice stayed in a traditional telephone set and the data stayed on the computer with the exception of the control information. If the voice does enter the computer, it is sent directly to the sound card or converted to a sound file for storage and possible file transfer. The voice communication is not transmitted in real time via IP protocols. In contrast, modern-day CTI is changing in that today the voice communications and control is being transmitted using IP protocols, and the hardware interfaces and telephones are being replaced by computer applications. 

NOTE: The CTI systems discussed here are not Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging applications, although some of the features are similar. CTI systems generally have a special function and are not a general user application. These are typically Call Center or Help Desk applications. This type of CTI typically involves integration with a database application. In this scenario, where soft-phones are an integral part of the CTI system/application, implementation of separate voice and data zones could be detrimental to the proper functioning of the application. While separation requirements should be enforced if possible, they could be relaxed providing the general CTI requirement of treating the CTI system as an enclave is followed. A system such as this should have its own VoIP controller. If the system needs to communicate with systems outside the CTI system enclave, proper boundary protection must be provided. For example, because IP soft-phones are prevalent in today&#x27;s call center/helpdesk systems, such a system would require the ability to place and receive phone calls from outside the CTI enclave. Calls might leave and enter the enclave via VoIP or a TDM media gateway. The workstations and call center agents may also need to email and access the web. 

NOTE: A network supporting a CTI application must be segregated from the enclave. This can be accomplished by maintaining a closed network or a segregated and access-controlled subenclave having appropriate boundary protection.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259910">V-259910</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The local Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging system must have the capability to place intrasite and local phone calls when network connectivity is severed from the remote centrally located session controller.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Voice phone services are critical to the effective operation of a business, an office, or in support or control of a DOD mission. It is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation, such as a security breach or life safety event. The ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. DOD voice networks are designed to be extremely reliable and provide continuity of operations (COOP) support. 

However, the potential exists that a site may become severed from the DOD network. Some site&#x27;s DOD VoIP phone systems are implemented without a local session controller. The session controller may be located remotely and serve several sites by providing long local service. This implementation scenario provides for central management of the overall phone system, saves in initial implementation cost, and saves in operating costs. Therefore, this scenario has many benefits. 

Unfortunately, to place a call between two endpoints within the local site or to place a call via the local commercial service connection, the initiating end instrument has to send its signal messages to the remote session controller over the DISN WAN connection, and then the session controller has to signal the called instrument or media gateway over the same WAN connection. Several messages are sent (back and forth) over the WAN connection before the two local endpoints can send their media streams directly between themselves. 

While the need to signal over the WAN connection can cause longer call setup time, which can be extended if there is congestion in the network, no call can be placed anywhere from the local site if it is cut off from its session controller. Based on this fact, and in support of maintaining viable local voice services in the event the site is cut off from its remote session controller, each physical site must maintain minimal local call control as a backup so that local intrasite and local commercial network calls can be placed. While this works to maintain local emergency service availability for security and life safety emergencies, it also provides the capability to make calls between DOD sites using the commercial network.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259911">V-259911</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The LAN hardware supporting VVoIP services must provide redundancy to support command and control (C2) assured services and Fire and Emergency Services (FES) communications.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Voice services in support of high-priority military command and control precedence must meet minimum requirements for reliability and survivability of the supporting infrastructure.

An additional, non-IA benefit is that this supports the ability to make local calls without having to pay toll charges to call a local number via some distant regional access point.

These types of connections must be approved and must meet the requirements in the Network Infrastructure STIG (NET0160) for an Internet Access Point (IAP).

ITSP connections may provide SIP trunks terminating on a media gateway, which then provides TDM trunks or POTS lines to traditional non-VoIP PBX, key system, or individual end instrument. ITSP connections terminating in a separate LAN from the enclave&#x27;s DOD LAN may support a separate VoIP system. This connection type might be used for a small site having a small VoIP system or a few discrete phones dedicated to commercial network calling. 

Additional guidance for the selection and procurement of telecommunications services is discussed in the DODI 8100.4 &quot;DOD Unified Capabilities (UC)&quot; dated 9 Dec 2010 and the DOD Unified Capabilities Requirements 2013 (UCR 2013) documents.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259920">V-259920</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The Fire and Emergency Services (FES) communications over a site&#x27;s telephone system must be configured to support the Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6055.06 telecommunication capabilities.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Emergency communications must include requests for fire, police, and medical assistance. In DOD, these communications can also include requests for Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF), explosive ordnance disposal, and similar emergency situations specific to the military. 

The inability of first responders to automatically locate the caller threatens life safety and facility protection or security. Contacting emergency services via the public telephone system has been mandated for many years in the United States and other countries around the world. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has mandated various aspects of providing enhanced FES communications and also relies on state legislation to extend these rules. The FCC rules primarily address public communications service providers, including traditional LEC and CLECs, mobile communications providers, and VoIP communications providers. 

DOD Instruction 6055.06, DOD Fire and Emergency Services (F&amp;ES) Program, provides DOD policy regarding emergency services and emergency services communications. The document primarily discusses fire protection, with specific provisions for telecommunications support for fire, medical, and security emergencies. Private telephone systems, in general, provide a large portion of the required telecommunication capability. All DOD private telephone systems, VoIP or traditional, must support enhanced emergency services communications for the completion of emergency calls. Per DOD Instruction 6055.06, all sites must support, provide for, and implement F&amp;ES telecommunications services. When implementing basic F&amp;ES telecommunications services, each country or region designates a specific standard telephone number or prefix code to be dialed that can be easily remembered by the public. In some instances, while not best practice, organizations might designate an internal emergency number for use within their telephone system. Examples of such numbers are as follows: 
- 911 in North America. 
- 112 in the EU and UK. 
- 000 in Australia. 

Issues may arise when an emergency call is originated through a private telephone system, such as a traditional PBX or a VVoIP system. While the LEC or CLEC may properly route the call in a priority manner, the same may not be true for the private system unless specifically addressed in the systems call routing tables and potentially other system features. Therefore, the private system must be configured to properly handle emergency communications. Enhanced F&amp;ES communications permits the answering station to automatically locate the caller. This is particularly helpful when the caller cannot provide their location. 

Enhanced F&amp;ES communications are mandated by the FCC and state legislation. Current implementation is a best practice. The enhanced F&amp;ES communications capability is enabled using Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and Phone Switch Automatic Location Identification (PS-ALI) information. ANI provides the telephone number of the calling party and is generated by the telephone system. PS-ALI associates the calling party&#x27;s number (ANI information) with their location or registered address of the phone being used. PS-ALI is provided by a database maintained within the telephone system or externally. In many cases, the F&amp;ES answering service system will use the PS-ALI information to map the location of the calling phone. VoIP phones, on the other hand, can be connected anywhere in the world and function. This is an issue for commercial VoIP services that is being addressed by the FCC. ALI information in the private sector must be handled by the owners/operators of private telephone system. When a private telephone system supports enhanced F&amp;ES telecommunications, a PS-ALI database must be instituted, maintained, and kept current as endpoints and numbers move at a site. 

NOTE: For fire and emergency services, the requirements are for the site. The requirement must be met through the unclassified system. Classified systems at the site, because they only operate in secure areas without connection to public services, do not need to implement this requirement.

Second, this phone number must be correlated to a physical address or location. This is called ALI information. 

ANI information comes from the telephone system controller. ALI information may come from an external database that associates the ANI information to the ALI information, or the telephone system controller may maintain the ALI database internally. If the ALI database is internal to the telephone system controller, emergency services answering point or call center only needs to receive ALI information, providing it contains the originating telephone number.

This is a two-part process that is exacerbated if the call originates from a DOD telephone system. 

Some of the FCC rules and state laws address the telephone system issue. For enterprise systems, the support for E911 by the enterprise Local Session Controller (LSC) (or any remote LSC construct) is governed by FCC rules, as well as other federal, state, and local law. The design and implementation of all telephone system systems must include reasonable efforts to provide E911, even when the access connection to the Enterprise LSC is severed.

Public enhanced F&amp;ES systems are implemented in conjunction with the local exchange carrier (LEC) using their central office switch (CO). When the designated F&amp;ES number is dialed, the CO routes the call to the public F&amp;ES answering point (PSAP) over special trunks that can provide the PSAP with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated and the geographic location of the originating telephone. The originating telephone number is provided as ANI information. The geographic location of the originating telephone is provided as ALI information. The ALI is generated from the ANI by looking up the ANI in a database. Typically, this function is performed by the LEC, and the ALI provided is the service delivery address for the telephone number. In some cases, the ALI information is housed in a database at the PSAP or a at a third-party provider such that the PSAP must make the &quot;database dip&quot; to identify the location of the caller. The information is regularly updated by the LEC based on new service deliveries and disconnections.

This process does not go far enough if the originating telephone is behind (part of) a DOD telephone system. A DOD telephone system may serve a large building or multiple buildings in a campus setting. It may also serve small or large remote sites that are geographically distant from the main telephone system switch. As discussed above, the normal process provides the address where the LEC delivers its phone service for the calling number. While this address will serve to get emergency services personnel to the lobby of a building or the front gate of a campus, it will not provide the exact location of the caller. This is where the federal and state telephone system related requirements come in. Under these rules, a telephone system operator and the system itself must provide complete ANI and ALI information to the answering point such that emergency services personnel can easily locate the caller. The telephone system must provide the exact location of the originating telephone minimally within a reasonably small area of it. The location information provided for telephones behind a telephone system is called Phone Switch-ALI (PS-ALI). 

To implement this, the telephone system must first be able to provide the F&amp;ES answering station with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated via ANI. If the answering point is outside the telephone system, the number provided must be the exact Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number of the telephone placing the call so the answering point can dial it directly. The number provided must not be that of an outbound trunk. This phone number must be correlated to its physical address or location within the facility via PS-ALI. 

To implement PS-ALI, the owner/operator of a telephone system is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date database containing the telephone number (DID number and/or extension number) and physical location of each telephone attached to the telephone system. This database is then used to provide the PS-ALI information to the ALI database(s) accessed by the F&amp;ES answering point. In association with each telephone and telephone number in the telephone system, the PS-ALI information contained in the database includes the following: 
- The address of the site containing the telephone system unless provided to the answering point by the LEC as part of its ANI/ALI information.
- The name (or number) of the building in which the telephone is located.
- The address of the building in which the telephone is located.
- The floor in the building on which the telephone is located.
- The area or quadrant of the floor where the telephone is located.
- The room or cubicle number where the telephone is located.

Additional information should be provided to the F&amp;ES answering point and emergency services personnel in the form of up-to-date facility maps and floor plans. The maintenance of facility maps, floor plans, and PS-ALI information to keep them up to date is critical to life safety and facility protection and security. This can be an onerous process in light of changes in the facility and moves, adds, and changes within the telephone system. Maintaining accurate location information is exacerbated in a VoIP telephone system due to the ability of an IP phone to change its physical location within the LAN (and possibly beyond) while keeping its telephone number without specific intervention from, or knowledge of, the telephone system operator. The PS_ALI database can quickly become inaccurate, which is a situation that could be life threatening. 

Automated systems can be used with a VoIP system and LAN to identify the general location of an IP phone within the facility based on the LAN switch and port to which the phone is connected. Once this information is obtained from the LAN, it is correlated with the documented location of the LAN switch and documented location of the outlet served by the switchport.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259923">V-259923</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300"><span>medium</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">The Fire and Emergency Services (F&amp;ES) communications over a site&#x27;s private telephone system must route emergency calls as a priority call in a nonblocking manner.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">When calling the designated F&amp;ES telephone number, the call must go through regardless of the state of other calls in the system.

- Receives AS-SIP-TLS messages from other MFSSs and a specific set of regionally associated LSCs to act as a call routing manager across the backbone. 
- Sends AS-SIP-TLS messages to interrogate the ability of another MFSS or an LSC to receive a call, whether routine or priority. 
- Sends AS-SIP-TLS messages to manage the establishment of priority calls and the preemption of lower priority calls to LSCs and other MFSSs.
- Once a &quot;trunk side&quot; session request is received, the MFSS determines if the destination is one of its assigned LSCs. If so, it interrogates that LSC to determine if it can receive the call. If so, it signals to establish the call. If the destination is not one of its LSCs, it signals with other MFSSs to locate the destination LSC and then the remote MFSS negotiates with its LSC. 
- Acts as a backup MFSS for LSCs assigned to other MFSSs as primary. An LSC must be able to signal with an MFSS to establish any call across the DISN WAN. LSCs do not interact directly with LSCs. This hierarchical arrangement is required in order to manage and establish priority calls and manage access circuit budgets. Each LSC must have a backup MFSS.

NOTE: This is applicable to a classified LAN connected to a classified WAN (such as the SIPRNet). 

In the case of a classified WAN where networkwide address-based accountability or traceability is required by the network PMO, the PMO must provide segregated, networkwide address block(s) so the attached classified LANs can meet this requirement. DISA provides a worldwide VoIP-based voice communications service called the DISN Voice over Secret IP (VoSIP). This service is managed by the DRSN PMO. This service also provides gateways into the DRSN. 

In support of the above requirement, the SIPRNet PMO has designated specific dedicated address ranges for use by the DISN VoSIP service and assigned these address blocks to the DRSN/VoSIP PMO for VoSIP address management and assignment. The VoSIP service provides VoIP-based communications between VoIP systems within the customer&#x27;s classified LANs (C-LANs) operating at the secret level while using the SIPRNet WAN for the inter-enclave (inter-LAN) transport. 

Additionally, the SIPRNet PMO requires networkwide address-based accountability or traceability based on assigned IP address. The customer&#x27;s SIPRNet-connected secret C-LANs use addresses assigned by the SIPRNet PMO. Therefore, customers of the DISN VoSIP service must use IP addresses assigned to them by the DRSN/VoSIP PMO when addressing the VoIP controllers and endpoints within their C-LANs. This is to maintain the segregation of the voice and data environments on the customer&#x27;s secret C-LANs as required by this SRG. This also facilitates proper routing and flow control over the traffic between VoSIP addresses. 

The DISN service is designated DISN Voice over Secret IP but uses an acronym (VoSIP), which also means Voice over Secure IP. Voice over Secure IP relates to any VoIP-based service on a secure or classified IP network. 

While the DISN VoSIP service is the preferred means to interconnect SIPRNet-connected secret C-LANs for VoIP service, there may be a need for an organization to implement a VoIP-based voice or video communications system within their organization or with close partners. If such a system has no need or potential need to communicate with other enclaves that use the DISN VoSIP service, they must use their own dedicated IP address space carved out of the address space assigned to their C-LANs by the SIPRNet PMO.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259918">V-259918</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 dark:bg-yellow-900 dark:text-yellow-300"><span>low</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Critical network equipment must be redundant and in geographically diverse locations for a site supporting command and control (C2) users.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">The enhanced reliability and availability achieved by the implementation of redundancy and geographic diversity throughout the DISN Core, along with the implementation of dual-homed circuits via geographically diverse pathways and facilities, is negated if both access circuits enter the enclave via the same facility containing a single Customer Edge Router (CER) connected to a single Session Border Controller (SBC). 

The reliability, redundancy, and robustness of the CER, SBC, and power source are subverted when the facility represents a single point of failure. For a small number of C2 users this may be less concerning, but with more C2 users supported by the system, the greater the issue. Even less severe eventualities may limit the capability of the system to support reliable communications. 

The mitigation for this systemwide vulnerability is to implement redundant facilities to which the geographically diverse pathways containing the dual-homed access circuits can run and terminate on redundant, geographically separated sets of CERs, SBCs, and core LAN equipment. Session controllers can also be separated in this manner. 

This mitigation is costly, and facilities housing critical communications infrastructure are not lost very often. However, the cost of mitigating this vulnerability must be weighed against the loss of critical communications, particularly in time of crisis. If the site supports large numbers of high-level C2 users or Special-C2 users, the cost of losing communications may outweigh the cost of providing redundant facilities. Another consideration should be that access to emergency services via the communications system would also be lost. 

The threat to strategic facilities is greater from natural causes than from damage due to acts of war or terrorism. However, all threats must be considered. Tactical facilities have a higher vulnerability to acts of war, on a par with or exceeding the vulnerability posed by natural events.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><a class="flex flex-col whitespace-nowrap" href="/stigs/EVVM_Policy_SRG/groups/V-259926">V-259926</a></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line "><span class="text-sm max-sm:text-xs font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 dark:bg-yellow-900 dark:text-yellow-300"><span>low</span></span></td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line ">Sufficient backup power must be provided for LAN infrastructure, WAN boundary, VVoIP infrastructure, and VVoIP endpoints to support non-command and control (C2) user accessible endpoints for emergency life safety and security calls.</td><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-300 whitespace-pre-line max-lg:hidden">Unified Capabilities (UC) users require different levels of capability depending on command and control needs.

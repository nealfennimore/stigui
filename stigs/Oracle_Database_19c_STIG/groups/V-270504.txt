16:Tb06,Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system, such as network interfaces, hard disks, modems, etc. From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited, as well.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked).

Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for determining which application components must provide auditable events.

Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the database management system (DBMS) configuration or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability.

The Department of Defense has established the following as the minimum set of auditable events:
- When privileges/permissions are retrieved, added, modified or deleted.
- When unsuccessful attempts to retrieve, add, modify, delete privileges/permissions occur.
- Enforcement of access restrictions associated with changes to the configuration of the database(s).
- When security objects are accessed, modified, or deleted.
- When unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete security objects occur.
- When categories of information (e.g., classification levels/security levels) are accessed, created, modified, or deleted.
- When unsuccessful attempts to access, create, modify, or delete categorized information occur.
- All privileged activities or other system-level access.
- When unsuccessful attempts to execute privileged activities or other system-level access occurs.
- When successful or unsuccessful access to any other objects occur as specifically defined by the site.
